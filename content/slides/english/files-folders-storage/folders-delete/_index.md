# How to Delete Folders

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, you should have:
- An Aspose Cloud account with valid credentials
- Basic understanding of REST APIs
- Familiarity with your preferred programming language
- Completed the previous tutorials on [folder operations](/files-folders-storage/folders-move/)

## Understanding Folder Deletion

Deleting folders is an important aspect of storage management that helps:
- Keep your storage organized and clean
- Remove unnecessary or outdated content
- Reduce storage costs by eliminating unused data
- Maintain a more manageable folder structure

However, folder deletion should be approached with caution, as deleted content cannot be easily recovered without proper backups.

## Step 1: Understanding the Delete Folder API

The `DeleteFolder` API method allows you to delete a folder and optionally its contents from your cloud storage.

API Information:

| API | Type | Description | Resource |
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
| /slides/storage/folder/{path} | DELETE | Deletes a folder from a storage | [DeleteFolder](https://reference.aspose.cloud/slides/#/Folder/DeleteFolder) |

Request Parameters:

| Name | Type | Location | Required | Description |
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
| path | string | path | true | The path to the folder to be deleted |
| storageName | string | query | false | The name of a storage |
| recursive | boolean | query | false | Enable to delete subfolders and files. The default value is false |

## Step 2: Obtaining an Access Token

First, authenticate with the Aspose.Slides Cloud API to get an access token:

### Java Example

```java
import com.aspose.slides.ApiException;
import com.aspose.slides.api.SlidesApi;
import com.aspose.slides.model.FilesList;
import com.aspose.slides.model.ObjectExist;
import com.aspose.slides.model.StorageFile;

public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize the API client with your credentials
        SlidesApi slidesApi = new SlidesApi("YOUR_CLIENT_ID", "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET");

        // Define the storage and folder to delete
        String storageName = "MyStorage";
        String folderToDelete = "MyFolder/MyPresentations";
        
        try {
            // Verify the folder exists
            ObjectExist objectExist = slidesApi.objectExists(folderToDelete, storageName, null);
            
            if (!objectExist.isExists() || !objectExist.getIsFolder()) {
                System.out.println("Folder '" + folderToDelete + "' does not exist or is not a folder.");
                return;
            }
            
            // Get folder contents for confirmation
            FilesList folderContents = slidesApi.getFilesList(folderToDelete, storageName);
            
            int fileCount = 0;
            int subfolderCount = 0;
            
            for (StorageFile item : folderContents.getValue()) {
                if (item.getIsFolder()) {
                    subfolderCount++;
                } else {
                    fileCount++;
                }
            }
            
            System.out.println("You are about to delete folder '" + folderToDelete + "' containing:");
            System.out.println("- " + fileCount + " file(s)");
            System.out.println("- " + subfolderCount + " subfolder(s)");
            System.out.println("This operation cannot be undone!");
            
            // In a real application, you might want to add a confirmation prompt here
            // Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
            // System.out.print("Are you sure you want to proceed? (y/n): ");
            // if (!scanner.nextLine().toLowerCase().equals("y")) return;
            
            System.out.println("Proceeding with deletion...");
            
            // Delete the folder recursively (including all contents)
            boolean recursive = true;
            slidesApi.deleteFolder(folderToDelete, storageName, recursive);
            
            System.out.println("Folder deleted successfully!");
            
            // Verify the folder no longer exists
            ObjectExist afterDeleteCheck = slidesApi.objectExists(folderToDelete, storageName, null);
            System.out.println("Folder still exists: " + afterDeleteCheck.isExists());
        } catch (ApiException e) {
            System.out.println("Error deleting folder: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

## Try It Yourself

1. Replace the placeholder credentials in the examples with your actual Aspose Cloud API credentials
2. Run the code to delete a test folder in your storage
3. Try both recursive and non-recursive deletion to understand the difference
4. Verify the results by checking if the folder still exists

## The Importance of the Recursive Parameter

The `recursive` parameter determines how the deletion operation handles folder contents:

| Recursive Value | Behavior | When to Use |
|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| `false` (default) | Only deletes the folder if it's empty | When you want to ensure no content is accidentally deleted |
| `true` | Deletes the folder and all its contents | When you want to remove the entire folder structure |

### Non-Recursive Deletion Example

```csharp
// This will only succeed if the folder is empty
bool recursive = false;
try {
    slidesApi.DeleteFolder(folderToDelete, storageName, recursive);
    Console.WriteLine("Empty folder deleted successfully!");
} catch (Exception ex) {
    Console.WriteLine("Error: " + ex.Message);
    Console.WriteLine("The folder might not be empty. Try with recursive=true to delete all contents.");
}
```

## Best Practices for Safe Folder Deletion

1. Always verify existence: Check if the folder exists before attempting to delete it
2. Implement confirmations: Require user confirmation before deleting folders with contents
3. Content inventory: List the contents that will be deleted to avoid surprises
4. Consider backups: For important folders, create backups before deletion
5. Use proper error handling: Handle API exceptions properly to catch issues

## Folder Cleanup Strategies

### Targeted Cleanup

```python
# Example: Delete only temporary folders
temp_folders = [
    "MyFolder/Temp",
    "MyFolder/Drafts/Temp",
    "MyFolder/Exports/Temp"
]

for folder in temp_folders:
    try:
        # Check if the folder exists
        folder_exists = slides_api.object_exists(folder, storage_name)
        if folder_exists.exists and folder_exists.is_folder:
            print(f"Deleting temporary folder: {folder}")
            slides_api.delete_folder(folder, storage_name, True)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error deleting {folder}: {str(e)}")
```

### Age-Based Cleanup

```csharp
// Example: Delete folders older than a certain date
void DeleteOldFolders(SlidesApi api, string basePath, DateTime olderThan)
{
    var contents = api.GetFilesList(basePath);
    
    foreach (var item in contents.Value)
    {
        if (item.IsFolder)
        {
            // Parse the modified date
            if (DateTime.TryParse(item.ModifiedDate, out DateTime modifiedDate))
            {
                if (modifiedDate < olderThan)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"Deleting old folder: {item.Path} (Modified: {modifiedDate})");
                    api.DeleteFolder(item.Path, recursive: true);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

// Usage: Delete folders not modified in the last 90 days
DeleteOldFolders(slidesApi, "Archives", DateTime.Now.AddDays(-90));
```

## Troubleshooting Tips

- Not Empty Errors: If you get errors about folders not being empty, make sure to use `recursive=true`
- Permission Issues: Ensure you have proper permissions to delete folders in the storage
- Path Format: Use forward slashes (`/`) for path separation
- Nested Deletions: When deleting nested folders, start with the deepest ones first if not using recursion
- Timing Issues: Large folder deletions may take time to complete fully

## Further Practice

To reinforce your learning, try these exercises:
