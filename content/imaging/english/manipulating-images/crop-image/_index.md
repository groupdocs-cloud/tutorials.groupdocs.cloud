# Tutorial: How to Crop Images with Aspose.Imaging Cloud

## Learning Objectives

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:
- Crop images by specifying the position and dimensions of a cropping rectangle
- Optionally convert the image format during cropping
- Implement image cropping both with and without cloud storage

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial, make sure you have:

1. An Aspose Cloud account (obtain a [free trial here](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps))
2. Your Client ID and Client Secret from the dashboard
3. Basic understanding of REST API concepts
4. Your preferred development environment set up (.NET, Java, or cURL)
5. Completed the [Resize Images Tutorial](/manipulating-images/resize-image/) (recommended)

## Practical Use Case

Image cropping is essential in numerous applications:
- Removing unwanted areas from photos
- Creating focused thumbnails for product catalogs
- Extracting specific regions of interest from larger images
- Creating profile pictures from full photos
- Standardizing image dimensions for a uniform layout

## Tutorial Steps

### Step 1: Understanding Image Crop API Options

Aspose.Imaging Cloud provides two API endpoints for cropping images:

1. With Storage (GET method): Upload your image to Cloud Storage first, then crop it using its name.
   - Endpoint: `GET /imaging/{name}/crop`

2. Without Storage (POST method): Directly send your image in the request body for cropping.
   - Endpoint: `POST /imaging/crop`

Both methods allow you to specify the position and dimensions of the cropping rectangle and optionally change the output format.

### Step 2: Authentication

Before making API calls, you need to obtain a JWT token:

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/connect/token" \
-X POST \
-d 'grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET' \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-H "Accept: application/json"
```

Save the returned JWT token for use in subsequent API calls.

### Step 3: Crop an Image (With Storage)

#### 3.1 First, upload your image to cloud storage

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3/imaging/storage/file/sample.jpg" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
-T /path/to/your/sample.jpg
```

#### 3.2 Crop the uploaded image

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3/imaging/sample.jpg/crop?format=png&x=10&y=10&width=400&height=300" \
-X GET \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: multipart/form-data" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
-o cropped_image.png
```

In this example:
- `x=10, y=10` - The top-left corner of the cropping rectangle (in pixels)
- `width=400, height=300` - The dimensions of the cropping rectangle (in pixels)
- `format=png` - The desired output format

### Step 4: Crop an Image (Without Storage)

For quick one-off cropping without storing the image first:

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3/imaging/crop?format=png&x=10&y=10&width=400&height=300" \
-X POST \
-T /path/to/your/sample.jpg \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
-o cropped_image.png
```

### Try It Yourself

Now it's your turn! Choose an image from your computer and try:
1. Cropping a region starting at position (50, 50) with size 200x200 pixels
2. Changing its format to JPG if it's not already in JPG format
3. Trying both the storage and non-storage methods

Remember to replace the placeholder values with your actual image path, JWT token, and desired parameters.

## SDK Implementation Examples

### C# (.NET) Example

```csharp
// Crop an image in cloud storage
public static void CropImageInCloud()
{
    // Get your clientId and clientSecret from https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/
    var imagingApi = new ImagingApi("YOUR_CLIENT_ID", "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET");
    
    try
    {
        // Upload an image to cloud storage (required for this example)
        string localInputImage = "YourImage.jpg";
        string uploadedImageName = "sample_image.jpg";
        string cloudFolder = "imaging_samples";
        
        using (FileStream imageStream = new FileStream(localInputImage, FileMode.Open))
        {
            UploadFileRequest uploadRequest = 
                new UploadFileRequest(cloudFolder + "/" + uploadedImageName, imageStream);
            imagingApi.UploadFile(uploadRequest);
        }
        
        // Set crop parameters
        int x = 10;        // X position of the top-left corner
        int y = 10;        // Y position of the top-left corner
        int width = 400;   // Width of the cropping rectangle
        int height = 300;  // Height of the cropping rectangle
        string format = "png"; // Convert to PNG format
        
        // Create request to crop the image
        CropImageRequest request = new CropImageRequest(
            uploadedImageName, x, y, width, height, format, cloudFolder);
            
        // Perform the crop operation
        using (var resultStream = imagingApi.CropImage(request))
        {
            // Save the cropped image to a local file
            using (FileStream fileStream = 
                new FileStream("cropped_image.png", FileMode.Create))
            {
                resultStream.CopyTo(fileStream);
            }
        }
        
        Console.WriteLine("Image has been successfully cropped!");
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Error: " + ex.Message);
    }
}
```

### Java Example

```java
// Crop an image in the request body
public static void cropImageWithoutStorage() throws Exception 
{
    // Get your clientId and clientSecret from https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/
    ImagingApi imagingApi = new ImagingApi("YOUR_CLIENT_ID", "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET");
    
    try 
    {
        // Specify the local image file path
        String localInputImage = "YourImage.jpg";
        
        // Prepare parameters for crop operation
        int x = 10;        // X position of the top-left corner
        int y = 10;        // Y position of the top-left corner
        int width = 400;   // Width of the cropping rectangle
        int height = 300;  // Height of the cropping rectangle
        String format = "png"; // Convert to PNG format
        
        // Read the image into a byte array
        byte[] imageData = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(localInputImage));
        
        // Create request for crop operation
        CreateCroppedImageRequest request = 
            new CreateCroppedImageRequest(imageData, x, y, width, height, format, null);
        
        // Perform the crop operation
        byte[] resultImage = imagingApi.createCroppedImage(request);
        
        // Save the cropped image to a local file
        Files.write(Paths.get("cropped_image.png"), resultImage);
        
        System.out.println("Image has been successfully cropped!");
    } 
    catch (Exception e) 
    {
        System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting Tips

- Authentication Errors: Ensure your Client ID and Client Secret are correct and your subscription is active.
- 404 Not Found: Check if the image path in cloud storage is correct.
- Invalid Crop Rectangle: Ensure that x, y, width, and height are positive integers and that the cropping rectangle is fully contained within the image bounds.
- Format Support: Not all image formats support all operations. Check the [format support documentation](https://docs.aspose.cloud/imaging/supported-file-formats/) for compatibility.

## What You've Learned

In this tutorial, you've learned how to:
- Authenticate with the Aspose.Imaging Cloud API
- Crop images by specifying a cropping rectangle
- Convert image formats during the crop operation
- Implement cropping with both storage and non-storage approaches
- Handle the API responses to save the cropped image

## Further Practice

To strengthen your understanding, try these additional exercises:
1. Create a tool that crops multiple images to the same dimensions
2. Implement center cropping (automatically determining x and y to crop from the center)
3. Create a function that crops an image to different aspect ratios (16:9, 4:3, 1:1)
