# Tutorial: Working with Pivot Filters in Aspose.Cells Cloud

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have:
- An Excel file with an existing pivot table
- Your Aspose Cloud API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret)

## Introduction

Pivot table filters allow you to focus on specific segments of your data, making it easier to analyze and draw conclusions. Filters can be applied to row fields, column fields, or as page fields (report filters) that affect the entire pivot table.

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to work with pivot filters using the Aspose.Cells Cloud API.

## Tutorial Steps

### Step 1: Authenticate with the API

First, obtain your access token:

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/connect/token" \
-X POST \
-d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-H "Accept: application/json"
```

Save the access token from the response for use in subsequent API calls.

### Step 2: Understanding Filter Types

Before adding filters, it's important to understand the different types of pivot filters available:

1. Value Filters: Filter based on the values in a data field
   - Examples: Top 10 items, values greater than a specific amount, etc.

2. Label Filters: Filter based on the text or labels in row/column fields
   - Examples: Labels containing specific text, labels that begin with certain characters, etc.

3. Date Filters: Specific filters for date fields
   - Examples: This month, last quarter, year to date, etc.

4. Custom Filters: Advanced filters combining multiple conditions
   - Examples: Sales between $1,000 and $5,000, products with names not containing "old model", etc.

### Step 3: Adding a Basic Pivot Filter

To add a filter to a pivot table, use the PUT endpoint:

```
PUT https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/cells/{name}/worksheets/{sheetName}/pivottables/{pivotTableIndex}/PivotFilters
```

Here's an example of adding a simple filter:

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/cells/Sales_Data.xlsx/worksheets/Sheet2/pivottables/0/PivotFilters?needReCalculate=true" \
-X PUT \
-d '{
  "FieldIndex": 1,
  "FilterType": "Count",
  "MeasureFldIndex": 3
}' \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

This adds a filter that shows only items with a count of values in the field at index 3.

Key parameters:
- `FieldIndex`: The 0-based index of the field to filter (1 in this example)
- `FilterType`: The type of filter to apply ("Count" in this example)
- `MeasureFldIndex`: The index of the measure field to use (3 in this example)
- `needReCalculate`: Set to true to recalculate the pivot table after applying the filter

### Step 4: Adding a Value Filter

Value filters are useful for focusing on items that meet specific criteria based on their numerical values. Here's an example of adding a "Top 10" filter:

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/cells/Sales_Data.xlsx/worksheets/Sheet2/pivottables/0/PivotFilters?needReCalculate=true" \
-X PUT \
-d '{
  "FieldIndex": 0,
  "FilterType": "Top10",
  "Value1": "10",
  "MeasureFldIndex": 3
}' \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

This filter shows only the top 10 items from field index 0, based on the values in field index 3.

For a "Bottom 10" filter, you would modify the request body:

```json
{
  "FieldIndex": 0,
  "FilterType": "Top10",
  "Value1": "10",
  "Value2": "False",  // False for bottom items
  "MeasureFldIndex": 3
}
```

### Step 5: Adding a Label Filter

Label filters allow you to filter items based on their text values. Here's an example of a label filter that shows only items with labels containing "East":

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/cells/Sales_Data.xlsx/worksheets/Sheet2/pivottables/0/PivotFilters?needReCalculate=true" \
-X PUT \
-d '{
  "FieldIndex": 1,
  "FilterType": "CaptionContains",
  "Value1": "East"
}' \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

This filter shows only items from field index 1 that have "East" in their labels.

### Step 6: Adding a Date Filter

For date fields, you can apply specialized date filters. Here's an example of a date filter that shows only data from a specific quarter:

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/cells/Sales_Data.xlsx/worksheets/Sheet2/pivottables/0/PivotFilters?needReCalculate=true" \
-X PUT \
-d '{
  "FieldIndex": 2,
  "FilterType": "DatePeriod",
  "Value1": "Q1"
}' \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

This filter shows only data from the first quarter (Q1) in field index 2.

### Step 7: Retrieving Filters

To check what filters are currently applied to a pivot table, use the GET endpoint:

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/cells/Sales_Data.xlsx/worksheets/Sheet2/pivottables/0/PivotFilters" \
-X GET \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

This returns information about all filters applied to the pivot table.

### Step 8: Retrieving a Specific Filter

To get details about a specific filter, use its index:

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/cells/Sales_Data.xlsx/worksheets/Sheet2/pivottables/0/PivotFilters/0" \
-X GET \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

This returns detailed information about the first filter (index 0) in the pivot table.

### Step 9: Removing a Specific Filter

To remove a specific filter, use the DELETE endpoint with the filter index:

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/cells/Sales_Data.xlsx/worksheets/Sheet2/pivottables/0/PivotFilters/0" \
-X DELETE \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

This removes the filter at index 0 from the pivot table.

### Step 10: Removing All Filters

To remove all filters from a pivot table, use the DELETE endpoint without specifying a filter index:

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/cells/Sales_Data.xlsx/worksheets/Sheet2/pivottables/0/PivotFilters" \
-X DELETE \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

This removes all filters from the pivot table.

## Try It Yourself

Now it's your turn to practice working with pivot filters:

1. Create a new Excel file with a simple pivot table (or use one from a previous tutorial)
2. Add a value filter (such as a Top 10 filter)
3. Add a label filter to show only specific categories
4. Retrieve information about your filters
5. Remove one of the filters
6. Remove all filters

    "Accept": "application/json"
}

auth_response = requests.post(auth_url, data=auth_data, headers=auth_headers)
access_token = auth_response.json().get("access_token")

# API headers
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"
}

file_name = "Sales_Data.xlsx"
sheet_name = "Sheet2"
pivot_index = 0
base_url = f"https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/cells/{file_name}/worksheets/{sheet_name}/pivottables/{pivot_index}"

# Add a Top 10 filter
filters_url = f"{base_url}/PivotFilters?needReCalculate=true"
top10_filter = {
    "FieldIndex": 0,
    "FilterType": "Top10",
    "Value1": "10",
    "MeasureFldIndex": 3
}
response = requests.put(filters_url, data=json.dumps(top10_filter), headers=headers)
print("Add Top 10 Filter Response:")
print(response.json())

# Add a label filter
label_filter = {
    "FieldIndex": 1,
    "FilterType": "CaptionContains",
    "Value1": "East"
}
response = requests.put(filters_url, data=json.dumps(label_filter), headers=headers)
print("\nAdd Label Filter Response:")
print(response.json())

# Get all filters
response = requests.get(filters_url, headers=headers)
print("\nGet All Filters Response:")
print(response.json())

# Get a specific filter
specific_filter_url = f"{base_url}/PivotFilters/0"
response = requests.get(specific_filter_url, headers=headers)
print("\nGet Specific Filter Response:")
print(response.json())

# Remove a specific filter
response = requests.delete(specific_filter_url, headers=headers)
print("\nRemove Specific Filter Response:")
print(response.json())

# Remove all filters
response = requests.delete(filters_url, headers=headers)
print("\nRemove All Filters Response:")
print(response.json())
```

## Common Filter Types and Their Uses

Here's a quick reference for common filter types and when to use them:

| Filter Type | Description | Use Case |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Top10 | Shows top or bottom N items | Find your best-selling products |
| CaptionEquals | Exact match for labels | Show data for a specific region |
| CaptionContains | Partial match for labels | Find products with "premium" in the name |
| CaptionGreaterThan | Labels alphabetically after a value | Companies starting with letters N-Z |
| DatePeriod | Date ranges like quarters, months | Compare quarterly sales performance |
| ValueEquals | Exact match for values | Find products with exactly $1,000 in sales |
| ValueGreaterThan | Values exceeding a threshold | Find high-value transactions (>$10,000) |
| ValueBetween | Values within a range | Analyze mid-range priced products |
| Count | Number of items | Filter by popularity (# of orders) |

## Best Practices for Using Pivot Filters

1. Start Broad, Then Narrow: Begin with minimal filtering, then add more specific filters as you focus your analysis

2. Combine Filter Types: Use both value filters and label filters together for more targeted analysis

3. Document Your Filters: Keep track of what filters you've applied, especially when sharing reports with others

4. Use Page Filters for Key Variables: Place important filtering fields (like Year, Region, or Product Category) as page filters for easy access

5. Avoid Over-Filtering: Too many filters can make your pivot table hard to understand and may hide important patterns

## What You've Learned

In this tutorial, you've learned:
- How to add different types of filters to your pivot tables
- How to work with value filters, label filters, and date filters
- How to retrieve information about existing filters
- How to remove specific filters or all filters from a pivot table
- Best practices for using filters effectively

## Troubleshooting Tips

- Filter Not Applied: Check that you're using the correct field index and filter type
