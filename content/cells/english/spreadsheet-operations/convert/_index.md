# Tutorial: Converting Excel Files to PDF with Aspose.Cells Cloud API

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have:
1. An Aspose Cloud account with an active subscription or free trial
2. Your Client ID and Client Secret from the [Aspose Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps)
3. Basic understanding of REST APIs and your preferred programming language
4. A sample Excel file for testing (you can use your own or download our sample)

## Introduction to Excel to PDF Conversion

Converting Excel spreadsheets to PDF is one of the most common tasks when working with spreadsheet data. PDFs provide a consistent, universal format that preserves your formatting and is easily shareable. The Aspose.Cells Cloud API provides multiple approaches to perform this conversion, giving you flexibility based on your specific requirements.

## Using the REST API

Aspose.Cells Cloud provides three different API endpoints to convert Excel to PDF:

1. `PUT /cells/convert` - Converts directly from request content (best for client-side applications)
2. `POST /cells/{name}/saveAs` - Saves an existing Excel file to PDF format in cloud storage
3. `GET /cells/{name}` - Exports a stored Excel file to PDF format

Let's explore each approach in detail.

## Approach 1: Direct Conversion with PUT /cells/convert

This approach is ideal when you have the Excel file locally and want to convert it in a single API call without storing it first.

### Try It Yourself: Using cURL

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/cells/convert?format=pdf" \
-X PUT \
-F "file=@YourExcelFile.xlsx" \
-H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
-H "Accept: multipart/form-data" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>"
```

Replace `<your_jwt_token>` with your actual authentication token. The response will contain the PDF file content that you can save to your local system.

### Implementation in C#

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-cells-cloud/aspose-cells-cloud-dotnet/

// Initialize the API with your client credentials
CellsApi cellsApi = new CellsApi(clientId, clientSecret);

// Prepare the conversion request
var fileStream = File.OpenRead("Book1.xlsx");
var request = new PutConvertWorkbookRequest(
    file: new Dictionary<string, Stream> { {"Book1.xlsx", fileStream} },
    format: "pdf"
);

// Execute the conversion
var response = cellsApi.PutConvertWorkbook(request);

// Save the resulting PDF
using (var fileStream = File.Create("output.pdf"))
{
    response.CopyTo(fileStream);
}

Console.WriteLine("Excel file successfully converted to PDF!");
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
// Initialize API client with your credentials
CellsApi cellsApi = new CellsApi(clientId, clientSecret);

// Prepare the conversion request
PutConvertWorkbookRequest request = new PutConvertWorkbookRequest();
request.setFormat("pdf");

// Add the input file
HashMap<String, File> fileMap = new HashMap<String, File>();
fileMap.put("Book1.xlsx", new File("Book1.xlsx"));
request.setFile(fileMap);

// Execute the conversion
File result = cellsApi.putConvertWorkbook(request);

// The result contains the PDF file
System.out.println("Excel file successfully converted to PDF!");
```

## Approach 2: SaveAs with POST /cells/{name}/saveAs

This approach is useful when your Excel file is already stored in Aspose Cloud Storage and you want to convert it to PDF.

### Try It Yourself: Using cURL

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/cells/Book1.xlsx/saveAs?newfilename=output.pdf" \
-X POST \
-d "{'SaveFormat':'pdf', 'EnableHTTPCompression': true}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>"
```

### Implementation in C#

```csharp
// Initialize the API with your client credentials
CellsApi cellsApi = new CellsApi(clientId, clientSecret);

// Upload your file to cloud storage first (if not already there)
cellsApi.UploadFile(new UploadFileRequest(
    uploadFiles: new Dictionary<string, Stream> { { "Book1.xlsx", File.OpenRead("Book1.xlsx") } },
    path: "Book1.xlsx"
));

// Prepare conversion options
var saveOptions = new PdfSaveOptions {
    SaveFormat = "pdf",
    EnableHTTPCompression = true,
    // Optional: Customize your PDF
    OnePagePerSheet = true
};

// Execute the conversion
var result = cellsApi.PostDocumentSaveAs(new PostDocumentSaveAsRequest(
    name: "Book1.xlsx",
    newfilename: "output.pdf",
    saveOptions: saveOptions
));

Console.WriteLine("Excel file successfully converted to PDF and saved to cloud storage!");
```

## Approach 3: Direct Export with GET /cells/{name}

This approach allows you to export an Excel file that's already in cloud storage directly to PDF format.

### Try It Yourself: Using cURL

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/cells/Book1.xlsx?format=pdf" \
-X GET \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>" \
-o output.pdf
```

### Implementation in C#

```csharp
// Initialize the API with your client credentials
CellsApi cellsApi = new CellsApi(clientId, clientSecret);

// Upload your file to cloud storage first (if not already there)
cellsApi.UploadFile(new UploadFileRequest(
    uploadFiles: new Dictionary<string, Stream> { { "Book1.xlsx", File.OpenRead("Book1.xlsx") } },
    path: "Book1.xlsx"
));

// Execute the export
var response = cellsApi.GetWorkbook(new GetWorkbookRequest(
    name: "Book1.xlsx",
    format: "pdf"
));

// Save the resulting PDF
using (var fileStream = File.Create("output.pdf"))
{
    response.CopyTo(fileStream);
}

Console.WriteLine("Excel file successfully exported to PDF!");
```

## Customizing PDF Conversion Options

Aspose.Cells Cloud offers many options to customize the PDF output. Here are some useful options you can include in your requests:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| OnePagePerSheet | Places each worksheet on a separate page |
| PrintingPageType | Controls page layout options (e.g., ignore blank pages) |
| Compliance | Sets PDF compliance level (PDF/A, etc.) |
| EmbedFullFonts | Embeds full fonts in the PDF |
| TextCompression | Sets text compression level |

### Example with Custom Options (C#)

```csharp
var saveOptions = new PdfSaveOptions {
    SaveFormat = "pdf",
    EnableHTTPCompression = true,
    OnePagePerSheet = true,
    Compliance = "PDF/A-1b",
    EmbedFullFonts = true
};

// Use this saveOptions object in your conversion request
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Authentication Failed
Solution: Double check your Client ID and Client Secret. Make sure you're correctly generating the JWT token.

### Issue: File Not Found
Solution: Verify that the file exists in your cloud storage or that you're correctly providing the file in your request.

### Issue: Converting Large Files
Solution: For large files, use the SaveAs approach with EnableHTTPCompression set to true.
