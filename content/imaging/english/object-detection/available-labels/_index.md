# Tutorial: Understanding Available Object Detection Labels

## Learning Objectives

In this tutorial, you'll learn:
- What object detection labels are and why they matter
- The complete list of object categories supported by Aspose.Imaging Cloud
- How to effectively use different object categories in your applications
- Strategies for working with specific object types
- Best practices for object detection with various categories

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, it's helpful to:
- Have basic familiarity with object detection concepts
- Understand how the Aspose.Imaging Cloud API works (covered in our [previous tutorials](/object-detection/detect-objects-json/)

## Introduction

Object detection labels (also called classes or categories) define what types of objects the AI model can recognize in images. Aspose.Imaging Cloud's object detection service is built on a comprehensive model that can identify a wide range of everyday objects, from people and animals to household items and environmental elements.

Understanding available labels is crucial for:
- Developing targeted applications that focus on specific object types
- Interpreting detection results accurately
- Filtering detections to focus on objects relevant to your use case

## 1. What Are Object Detection Labels?

In computer vision, labels are predefined categories that an AI model is trained to recognize. When the model processes an image, it assigns each detected object to one of these categories based on its visual features.

Aspose.Imaging Cloud uses the Single Shot Detector (SSD) method with a rich set of labels organized into intuitive categories.

## 3. Using Labels in Your API Requests

When using the Aspose.Imaging Cloud API for object detection, you don't need to specify which labels to detectâ€”the service automatically identifies all recognizable objects in the image. However, you can filter the results in your application code based on the labels you're interested in.

### Try it yourself: Filtering Detection Results by Label

Here's a simple C# example of filtering detection results to focus on specific labels:

```csharp
// Tutorial Code Example - Filtering Object Detection Results by Label
using Aspose.Imaging.Cloud.Sdk.Api;
using Aspose.Imaging.Cloud.Sdk.Model.Requests;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

namespace AsposeTutorials
{
    class ObjectLabelFilteringTutorial
    {
        // Your Client ID and Client Secret
        private const string ClientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID";
        private const string ClientSecret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET";

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Create instance of API
            var imagingApi = new ImagingApi(ClientId, ClientSecret);
            
            // Detect objects in an image
            string imageName = "street_scene.jpg";
            
            try
            {
                var request = new GetObjectBoundsRequest(
                    name: imageName,
                    method: "ssd",
                    threshold: 40, // Lower threshold to catch more objects
                    includeLabel: true,
                    includeScore: true
                );

                var detectionResult = imagingApi.GetObjectBounds(request);
                
                // Define categories of interest
                var vehicleLabels = new HashSet<string> { "car", "truck", "motorcycle", "bus", "bicycle" };
                var personLabels = new HashSet<string> { "person" };
                var trafficLabels = new HashSet<string> { "traffic-light", "stop-sign" };
                
                // Filter results by category
                var vehicles = detectionResult.DetectedObjects
                    .Where(obj => vehicleLabels.Contains(obj.Label))
                    .ToList();
                    
                var people = detectionResult.DetectedObjects
                    .Where(obj => personLabels.Contains(obj.Label))
                    .ToList();
                    
                var trafficSigns = detectionResult.DetectedObjects
                    .Where(obj => trafficLabels.Contains(obj.Label))
                    .ToList();
                
                // Report results by category
                Console.WriteLine($"Found {vehicles.Count} vehicles:");
                foreach (var vehicle in vehicles)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"- {vehicle.Label} (Score: {vehicle.Score:F2})");
                }
                
                Console.WriteLine($"\nFound {people.Count} people");
                
                Console.WriteLine($"\nFound {trafficSigns.Count} traffic signs:");
                foreach (var sign in trafficSigns)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"- {sign.Label} (Score: {sign.Score:F2})");
                }
                
                // Count all unique object types
                var labelCounts = detectionResult.DetectedObjects
                    .GroupBy(obj => obj.Label)
                    .Select(g => new { Label = g.Key, Count = g.Count() })
                    .OrderByDescending(x => x.Count);
                    
                Console.WriteLine("\nObject types detected:");
                foreach (var label in labelCounts)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"- {label.Label}: {label.Count}");
                }
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## 4. Practical Applications for Different Label Categories

Different label categories are suited for specific application domains:

### Retail and Inventory
Focus on product-related labels like:
- food items (apple, banana, etc.)
- packaged goods (bottle)
- clothing items (backpack, shoe, etc.)

### Traffic Monitoring
Focus on transportation and infrastructure labels:
- vehicles (car, truck, bus, etc.)
- traffic signs (traffic-light, stop-sign)
- roads and bridges

### Home Automation
Focus on household and furniture labels:
- appliances (refrigerator, microwave, etc.)
- furniture (chair, couch, bed, etc.)
- electronics (tv, laptop, etc.)

### Security Systems
Focus on people and activity-related labels:
- person
- vehicles (car, motorcycle)
- personal items (suitcase, backpack)

## 5. Label Accuracy and Challenges

The accuracy of object detection varies by label and is influenced by factors like:

- Object size: Larger objects typically have higher detection accuracy
- Occlusion: Partially hidden objects are harder to detect correctly
- Lighting conditions: Poor lighting can reduce detection accuracy
- Object orientation: Unusual angles can challenge the detection model
- Visual similarity: Some objects may be confused with visually similar categories

### Label Confidence Tips

- For critical applications, filter objects by confidence score (e.g., above 0.7)
- For general-purpose applications, a threshold of 0.5 (50%) often works well
- For maximum recall at the cost of precision, use a lower threshold (e.g., 0.3)

## 6. Advanced Label Strategies

### Hierarchical Grouping

You can create logical hierarchies to organize detection results:

```python
# Tutorial Code Example - Hierarchical Label Grouping in Python
def group_detections_hierarchically(detections):
    hierarchy = {
        "living_beings": {
            "person": [],
            "animals": {
                "pets": ["dog", "cat"],
                "farm": ["cow", "horse", "sheep"],
                "wild": ["elephant", "bear", "zebra", "giraffe", "bird"]
            }
        },
        "vehicles": {
            "road": ["car", "motorcycle", "bus", "truck", "bicycle"],
            "rail": ["train"],
            "air": ["airplane"],
            "water": ["boat"]
        },
        # Add more categories as needed
    }
    
    # Implementation would map detections to this hierarchy
    # (Code for the actual mapping would go here)
    
    return grouped_results
```

### Label Co-occurrence

Detecting relationships between commonly co-occurring objects can provide context:

```javascript
// Tutorial Code Example - Detecting Label Co-occurrence
function detectScenes(detectedObjects) {
    // Define scene patterns based on co-occurring labels
    const scenePatterns = {
        "kitchen": ["refrigerator", "microwave", "sink", "oven"],
        "dining": ["dining-table", "chair", "plate", "cup", "fork", "knife"],
        "living_room": ["couch", "tv", "remote", "chair"],
        "office": ["desk", "laptop", "keyboard", "mouse"],
        "traffic": ["car", "traffic-light", "road"],
        // Add more scenes as needed
    };
    
    // Count matches for each scene
    let sceneScores = {};
    const labels = detectedObjects.map(obj => obj.label);
    
    for (const [scene, sceneLabels] of Object.entries(scenePatterns)) {
        const matchCount = sceneLabels.filter(label => labels.includes(label)).length;
        const matchPercentage = matchCount / sceneLabels.length;
        sceneScores[scene] = matchPercentage;
    }
    
    // Find the best matching scene(s)
    return Object.entries(sceneScores)
        .filter(([_, score]) => score > 0.5) // At least 50% match
        .sort(([_, scoreA], [_, scoreB]) => scoreB - scoreA)
        .map(([scene, score]) => ({ scene, confidence: score }));
}
```
