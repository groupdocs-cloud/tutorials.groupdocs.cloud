# Tutorial: How to Update TIFF Parameters for Fax Compatibility

## Learning Objectives

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:
- Modify TIFF images to make them compatible with fax standards
- Understand fax-compatible TIFF parameters
- Upload, process, and download TIFF images using the Aspose.Imaging Cloud API
- Implement TIFF-to-fax conversion in your applications

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial, make sure you have:

1. An Aspose Cloud account (obtain a [free trial here](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps))
2. Your Client ID and Client Secret from the dashboard
3. Basic understanding of REST API concepts
4. Your preferred development environment set up (.NET, Java, or cURL)
5. One or more TIFF images for testing
6. Completed the [Appending TIFF Images Tutorial](/manipulating-images/append-tiff/) (recommended)

## Practical Use Case

Converting TIFF images to fax-compatible format is essential for:
- Digital faxing systems that require standardized TIFF formats
- Document archiving systems that need to store fax-compatible documents
- Legal and medical offices that frequently exchange documents via fax
- Enterprise document workflows involving legacy fax systems
- Compliance with regulations requiring fax-compatible document formats

## Understanding Fax-Compatible TIFF Parameters

Fax-compatible TIFF files conform to specific standards (typically ITU-T specifications) with parameters like:
- Black and white (monochrome) image
- Fixed resolutions (commonly 204x196 dpi)
- CCITT Group 3 or Group 4 compression
- Single or multi-page format
- Special header information

## Tutorial Steps

### Step 1: Understanding the TIFF to Fax API

Aspose.Imaging Cloud provides a dedicated API endpoint for converting standard TIFF images to fax-compatible TIFF format:

- Endpoint: `GET /imaging/tiff/{name}/toFax`

This API requires your original TIFF file to be stored in Cloud Storage before the operation. After processing, the API returns the fax-compatible TIFF in the response.

### Step 2: Authentication

Before making API calls, you need to obtain a JWT token:

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/connect/token" \
-X POST \
-d 'grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET' \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-H "Accept: application/json"
```

Save the returned JWT token for use in subsequent API calls.

### Step 3: Upload Your TIFF Image to Cloud Storage

First, upload your TIFF image to cloud storage:

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3/imaging/storage/file/Sample.tiff" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
-T /path/to/your/Sample.tiff
```

### Step 4: Convert TIFF to Fax-Compatible Format

Now convert the uploaded TIFF file to fax-compatible format:

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3/imaging/tiff/Sample.tiff/toFax" \
-X GET \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: multipart/form-data" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
-o sample_fax.tiff
```

The API will process the TIFF file and return a fax-compatible version which will be saved to `sample_fax.tiff`.

### Step 5: Verify the Fax-Compatible TIFF

You can verify the converted file is fax-compatible by:
- Opening it in a TIFF viewer
- Checking the image properties (should be black and white with appropriate resolution)
- Attempting to send it via a fax system or service

### Try It Yourself

Now it's your turn! Select a TIFF file and try:
1. Uploading it to cloud storage
2. Converting it to fax-compatible format
3. Downloading and verifying the result
4. Comparing the original and fax-compatible versions to observe the differences

Remember to replace the placeholder values with your actual file paths, JWT token, and desired parameters.

## SDK Implementation Examples

### C# (.NET) Example

```csharp
// Update parameters of a TIFF image according to fax parameters
public static void UpdateTIFFForFaxCompatibility()
{
    // Get your clientId and clientSecret from https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/
    var imagingApi = new ImagingApi("YOUR_CLIENT_ID", "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET");
    
    try
    {
        // Upload the TIFF file to cloud storage
        string localInputTiff = "Sample.tiff";
        string cloudTiff = "Sample.tiff";
        
        using (FileStream inputStream = new FileStream(localInputTiff, FileMode.Open))
        {
            UploadFileRequest uploadRequest = 
                new UploadFileRequest(cloudTiff, inputStream);
            imagingApi.UploadFile(uploadRequest);
        }
        
        // Create request for the fax conversion operation
        ConvertTiffToFaxRequest request = new ConvertTiffToFaxRequest(cloudTiff);
            
        // Perform the conversion operation
        using (var resultStream = imagingApi.ConvertTiffToFax(request))
        {
            // Save the fax-compatible TIFF to a local file
            using (FileStream fileStream = 
                new FileStream("sample_fax.tiff", FileMode.Create))
            {
                resultStream.CopyTo(fileStream);
            }
        }
        
        Console.WriteLine("TIFF image has been successfully converted to fax-compatible format!");
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Error: " + ex.Message);
    }
}
```

### Java Example

```java
// Update parameters of a TIFF image according to fax parameters
public static void updateTIFFForFaxCompatibility() throws Exception 
{
    // Get your clientId and clientSecret from https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/
    ImagingApi imagingApi = new ImagingApi("YOUR_CLIENT_ID", "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET");
    
    try 
    {
        // Upload the TIFF file to cloud storage
        String localInputTiff = "Sample.tiff";
        String cloudTiff = "Sample.tiff";
        
        byte[] inputData = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(localInputTiff));
        UploadFileRequest uploadRequest = 
            new UploadFileRequest(cloudTiff, inputData, null);
        imagingApi.uploadFile(uploadRequest);
        
        // Create request for the fax conversion operation
        ConvertTiffToFaxRequest request = new ConvertTiffToFaxRequest(cloudTiff, null);
            
        // Perform the conversion operation
        byte[] resultImage = imagingApi.convertTiffToFax(request);
        
        // Save the fax-compatible TIFF to a local file
        Files.write(Paths.get("sample_fax.tiff"), resultImage);
        
        System.out.println("TIFF image has been successfully converted to fax-compatible format!");
    } 
    catch (Exception e) 
    {
        System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting Tips

- Authentication Errors: Ensure your Client ID and Client Secret are correct and your subscription is active.
- 404 Not Found: Check if the image path in cloud storage is correct.
- Invalid TIFF Format: Ensure the source file is a valid TIFF file.
- Conversion Issues: Some complex TIFF images with special features may not convert correctly. Try simplifying the image first.
- Color Information Loss: Remember that fax-compatible TIFFs are black and white, so color information will be lost during conversion.
