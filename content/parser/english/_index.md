## Implementation Best Practices

### Performance Optimization Strategies

**Batch Processing**: Group similar documents together to reduce API calls and improve throughput. The API handles concurrent requests efficiently.

**Selective Extraction**: Only extract the data you need. If you just need text, don't request images and metadata - it'll speed up processing significantly.

**Caching Results**: Implement local caching for frequently accessed documents to reduce API usage and improve response times.

### Error Handling and Reliability

**Graceful Degradation**: Always implement fallback logic for unsupported formats or corrupted files.

**Retry Logic**: Network issues happen - implement exponential backoff retry mechanisms for failed requests.

**Validation**: Verify extracted data quality, especially for critical business processes.

### Security Considerations

**Token Management**: Rotate API keys regularly and store them securely (never in source code).

**Data Privacy**: Understand data retention policies and ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR.

**Transmission Security**: All API communications use HTTPS encryption, but verify this in your implementation.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Authentication Problems
**Issue**: "Unauthorized" or "Invalid credentials" errors
**Solution**: Double-check your API key and ensure it's properly included in request headers. Verify the key hasn't expired.

### Large File Processing
**Issue**: Timeouts with large documents (>50MB)
**Solution**: Consider breaking large documents into smaller chunks or using asynchronous processing endpoints.

### Format-Specific Errors
**Issue**: Extraction fails for specific document types
**Solution**: Verify the document isn't corrupted by testing with a known-good file of the same format.

### Rate Limiting
**Issue**: "Too Many Requests" responses
**Solution**: Implement proper rate limiting in your application and consider upgrading your plan for higher throughput.

## Performance Optimization Tips

**Document Size Considerations**: Files under 10MB process fastest. For larger files, expect proportionally longer processing times.

**Concurrent Requests**: Most plans support multiple simultaneous requests. Check your plan limits and optimize accordingly.

**Regional Endpoints**: Use the API endpoint closest to your users' location for best performance.

**Format Optimization**: PDF and DOCX files generally process faster than image-heavy presentations or complex spreadsheets.

## Advanced Implementation Topics

### Custom Parsing Templates
Create reusable templates for documents with consistent structures. This dramatically improves accuracy and processing speed for repetitive document types.

### Webhook Integration
Set up real-time notifications for document processing completion, especially useful for large batch operations.

### Multi-Language Support
The API handles documents in multiple languages automatically, with special optimizations for RTL languages and complex scripts.
