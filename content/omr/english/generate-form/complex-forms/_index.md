## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, you should:
- Have an [Aspose Cloud account](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps)
- Have completed the [previous tutorials](/generate-form/) in this series
- Understand form [generation settings](/generate-form/settings/)
- Have experience generating basic forms

## Introduction

While simple forms are adequate for many scenarios, complex applications often require multi-page forms with various element types and sophisticated layouts. In this tutorial, we'll explore advanced techniques for creating complex OMR forms that can handle diverse data collection needs while maintaining usability and recognition accuracy.

## Practical Scenario

You're developing a comprehensive employee evaluation system for a large corporation. The assessment includes multiple sections:
- Personal information and demographics
- Skills assessment with various rating scales
- Multiple-choice knowledge assessment
- Open-ended performance evaluation
- Manager feedback and recommendations

This complex evaluation requires a multi-page form with different element types and a professional, organized layout.

## Step 1: Understanding Multi-Page Form Structure

In Aspose.OMR markup language, multi-page forms are created using the `&page` element. Each page is defined independently and can have different layouts and elements.

Here's a basic structure for a multi-page form:

```
?text=Employee Evaluation Form
	font_size=24
	font_style=bold
	align=center
?empty_line=
?text=Page 1: Personal Information
	font_size=14
	font_style=bold
?empty_line=
// Page 1. Personal Information elements go here...

&page
?text=Employee Evaluation Form
	font_size=24
	font_style=bold
	align=center
?empty_line=
?text=Page 2: Skills Assessment
	font_size=14
	font_style=bold
?empty_line=
// Page 2. Skills Assessment elements go here...

&page
// Page 3 and so on...
```

> Tip: While each page starts fresh in terms of layout, you can maintain visual consistency by repeating headers, footers, and styling across pages.

## Step 2: Planning Your Complex Form

Before writing any markup, plan your form structure carefully:

1. Determine Content Division:
   - What information belongs on each page?
   - How many pages will you need?
   - What is the logical flow of information?

2. Select Appropriate Elements:
   - Which question types best suit each section?
   - What specialized elements might you need?

3. Establish Visual Hierarchy:
   - How will you differentiate sections and subsections?
   - What visual cues will guide users through the form?

4. Consider Space Requirements:
   - How much space do different question types need?
   - How will you accommodate varying response lengths?

## Step 3: Creating a Multi-Page Form

Let's build our employee evaluation form step by step:

### Page 1: Personal Information

```
?text=Employee Evaluation Form
	font_size=24
	font_style=bold
	align=center
?image=company_logo.png
	align=right
	width=150
?empty_line=
?text=Page 1: Personal Information
	font_size=16
	font_style=bold
?empty_line=

?text=Employee Name:_____________________________
?text=Employee ID:_____________ Department:_______________ 
?text=Position:________________ Hire Date:_______________
?empty_line=

?text=Employment Status:
	font_style=bold
?answer=Employment Status,Full-time,Part-time,Contract,Temporary
	bubble_type=square

?text=Years in Current Position:
	font_style=bold
?answer=Years,Less than 1,1-3,3-5,5-10,More than 10

?empty_line=
?text=OFFICE USE ONLY
	font_style=bold
	underline=true
?text=Evaluated by:_______________ Date:_______________
?barcode=EMP_EVAL_PAGE_1
	codetext=true
	align=right
```

### Page 2: Skills Assessment

```
&page
?text=Employee Evaluation Form
	font_size=24
	font_style=bold
	align=center
?empty_line=
?text=Page 2: Skills Assessment
	font_size=16
	font_style=bold
?empty_line=

?text=Rate the employee's proficiency in the following areas:
	font_style=italic
?empty_line=

?text=Technical Skills
	font_style=bold
?grid=Technical Skills
	sections_count=5
	options_count=5
	header_type=underline
	options=Poor,Fair,Average,Good,Excellent

```

### Page 3: Knowledge Assessment

```
&page
?text=Employee Evaluation Form
	font_size=24
	font_style=bold
	align=center
?empty_line=
?text=Page 3: Knowledge Assessment
	font_size=16
	font_style=bold
?empty_line=

?text=This section assesses job-specific knowledge. Select the best answer for each question.
	font_style=italic
?empty_line=

?text=1. Which company policy addresses remote work procedures?
?answer=Q1,Employee Handbook Section 2.1,Department Guidelines,Team Leader Discretion,HR Manual Section 4.3
	bubble_size=small

?text=2. What is the correct procedure for requesting time off?
?answer=Q2,Submit paper form,Email manager,Use HR Portal,Call HR department
	bubble_size=small

?text=3. Who should be notified in case of a workplace safety incident?
?answer=Q3,Department Manager,Safety Officer,HR Representative,All of the above
	bubble_size=small

?text=4. Which document contains information about the performance review process?
?answer=Q4,Employee Handbook,Department Manual,Company Website,Performance Management System

?text=5. What is the company's standard notice period for resignation?
?answer=Q5,One week,Two weeks,One month,Based on position level
	bubble_size=small

?barcode=EMP_EVAL_PAGE_3
	codetext=true
	align=right
```

> Try it yourself: Generate these three pages and observe how they form a cohesive multi-page form.

## Step 4: Using Advanced Elements

Let's enhance our form with more advanced elements on a fourth page:

```
&page
?text=Employee Evaluation Form
	font_size=24
	font_style=bold
	align=center
?empty_line=
?text=Page 4: Performance Evaluation
	font_size=16
	font_style=bold
?empty_line=

?text=Rate overall performance in key areas:
	font_style=italic
?empty_line=

// Custom answer sheet for numerical ratings
?custom_answer_sheet=Performance
	columns_count=1
	elements_count=5
	answers_count=10
	column_proportions=100
	elements=Productivity,Quality of Work,Initiative,Reliability,Overall Performance

?empty_line=
?text=Does this employee consistently meet performance goals?
?answer=Goals,Yes,No,Partially
	orientation=horizontal

?empty_line=
?text=Recognition and Achievements:
?content=Achievements
	height=200
	elements_count=5
	columns_count=2
	border=true

?empty_line=
?text=Development Areas:
?write_in=Development
	height=150
	border=true

?barcode=EMP_EVAL_PAGE_4
	codetext=true
	align=right
```

In this page, we've incorporated:
- A custom answer sheet for numerical ratings
- A multi-column content area for achievements
- A write-in area for development notes

## Step 5: Creating Reusable Content Blocks

For complex forms, you can define reusable content blocks using the `$block` and `$include` elements. This is particularly useful for:
- Headers and footers that appear on every page
- Standard question groups that repeat throughout the form
- Common assessment scales or rating systems

### Defining a Block

```
$block=page_header
?text=Employee Evaluation Form
	font_size=24
	font_style=bold
	align=center
?image=company_logo.png
	align=right
	width=150
?empty_line=
$block

$block=page_footer
?empty_line=
?text=Confidential - XYZ Corporation
	font_size=8
	align=center
?text=Page $page_num of $total_pages
	font_size=8
	align=right
$block
```

### Including a Block

```
&page
$include=page_header
?text=Page 5: Manager's Feedback
	font_size=16
	font_style=bold
?empty_line=

// Page content goes here...

$include=page_footer
```

Using blocks makes your form markup more maintainable and ensures consistency across pages.

> Tip: When making changes to a block, you only need to update it in one place, and the changes will be reflected wherever the block is included.

## Step 6: Implementing Specialized Elements

Complex forms often require specialized elements for specific data collection needs. Let's add a final page with some of these elements:

```
&page
$include=page_header
?text=Page 5: Additional Assessment
	font_size=16
	font_style=bold
?empty_line=

?text=Project Contributions
	font_style=bold
?table=Projects
	columns_count=4
	header_type=grid
	headers=Project Name,Role,Duration (months),Outcome
	row_proportions=40,20,10,30
	rows_count=3
	table_appearance=without_header

?empty_line=
?text=Skills Matrix
	font_style=bold
?custom_answer_sheet=Skills
	columns_count=5
	elements_count=5
	answers_count=3
	column_proportions=40,20,20,20
	elements=Technical Skills,Communication,Leadership,Problem Solving,Adaptability
	headers=Novice,Proficient,Expert

?empty_line=
?text=Future Development Recommendations (select all that apply):
	font_style=bold
?checkbox=Development
	elements_count=6
	elements=Technical Training,Leadership Development,Communication Workshop,Project Management,Industry Certification,Mentoring Program

$include=page_footer
```

This page includes:
- A table for project information
- A custom skills matrix with headers
- A checkbox group for multiple selections

## Step 7: Optimizing for Recognition Accuracy

Complex forms present unique challenges for recognition accuracy. Here are key strategies to ensure reliable results:

### 1. Include Alignment Elements

Barcodes or QR codes on each page help the recognition engine align and identify pages correctly:

```
?barcode=PAGE_5
	value=employee_eval_p5
	codetext=true
	align=right
```

### 2. Maintain Consistent Bubble Spacing

For complex forms, maintain consistent spacing between bubbles and ensure they don't overlap:

```
?answer=Satisfaction,Very Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Neutral,Satisfied,Very Satisfied
	bubble_size=normal
	font_size=10
```

### 3. Use Clear Section Separators

Visually separate sections with empty lines and borders:

```
?empty_line=
?text=Section Divider
	font_style=bold
	underline=true
?empty_line=
```

### 4. Include Page Numbers and Form Identifiers

Always include page numbers and form identifiers to prevent confusion:

```
?text=Form ID: EMP-EVAL-2025 | Page 5 of 5
	align=right
	font_size=8
```

## Step 8: Testing and Refining Your Form

Before finalizing your complex form, it's important to test and refine it:

1. Generate a Test Version:
   Generate the form and print it to check layout and appearance.

2. Perform a Usability Test:
   Have several people fill out the form and provide feedback.

3. Check Recognition Accuracy:
   Fill out the form with known answers and verify that the recognition is accurate.

4. Iterate and Improve:
   Refine your form based on testing results, adjusting layouts and instructions as needed.

> Try it yourself: Generate your multi-page form, print it, fill it out, and test the recognition accuracy.

## Troubleshooting Complex Forms

### Issue: Pages Are Not Recognized in Order

Solution: 
- Add unique barcodes to each page
- Include page numbers in a consistent location
- Ensure form identifiers are present on each page

### Issue: Inconsistent Layout Across Pages

Solution:
- Use content blocks for headers and footers
- Maintain consistent margins and spacing
- Use the same font and styling for similar elements

### Issue: Poor Recognition of Dense Elements

Solution:
- Increase spacing between elements
- Use larger bubble sizes where space permits
- Reduce the number of elements per page
