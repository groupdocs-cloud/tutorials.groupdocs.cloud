# Tutorial: How to Upload Diagram Files for Conversion

## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to upload diagram files to Aspose.Diagram Cloud storage, which is a prerequisite for many operations including format conversion. Understanding how to properly upload files is essential for working with the Aspose.Diagram Cloud API.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:
- Upload diagram files to Aspose Cloud Storage
- Verify successful file uploads
- Understand different upload methods
- Implement file upload functionality in your applications

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have:
- An Aspose Cloud account ([get a free trial here](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps))
- Your Client ID and Client Secret from the [Aspose Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/)
- A diagram file on your local system that you want to upload
- Basic understanding of REST APIs

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Authentication

As always, we begin by authenticating with the Aspose.Diagram Cloud API to obtain an access token.

#### Using cURL

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/connect/token" \
-X POST \
-d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-H "Accept: application/json"
```

Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET` with your actual credentials.

### 2. Uploading a Diagram File

There are two main methods to upload files to Aspose.Diagram Cloud storage:

#### Method 1: Using Direct Upload Endpoint

This method uses the `/diagram/{name}/upload` endpoint to upload a file directly to your cloud storage.

##### Using cURL

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/v1.1/diagram/mydrawing.vsdx/upload?IsOverwrite=true" \
-X PUT \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
--data-binary @/path/to/local/file.vsdx
```

Replace:
- `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the token obtained in step 1
- `mydrawing.vsdx` with your desired filename in cloud storage
- `/path/to/local/file.vsdx` with the path to your local file

If successful, you'll receive a response like:

```json
{
  "Code": 200,
  "Status": "OK"
}
```

#### Method 2: Using the Storage API

This method uses the general storage file upload API, which works for any file type, not just diagrams.

##### Using cURL

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/diagram/storage/file/mydrawing.vsdx" \
-X PUT \
-H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
--data-binary @/path/to/local/file.vsdx
```

The response will be similar to:

```json
{
  "uploaded": [
    "mydrawing.vsdx"
  ],
  "errors": []
}
```

### 3. Verifying the Upload

After uploading, it's good practice to verify that the file was uploaded correctly. You can do this by retrieving information about the diagram using the method from our first tutorial.

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/v1.1/diagram/mydrawing.vsdx" \
-X GET \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

If the file is accessible, you'll receive information about the diagram structure.

### 4. Implementing with SDKs

#### C# Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Diagnostics;
using Aspose.Diagram.Cloud.Sdk.Api;
using Aspose.Diagram.Cloud.Sdk.Model;

namespace DiagramTutorials
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Configure API key authorization
            var config = new Configuration
            {
                ClientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
                ClientSecret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" 
            };

            var diagramApi = new DiagramFileApi(config);
            
            try
            {
                // Set the upload parameters
                string remoteFilename = "mydrawing.vsdx";  // Destination filename in cloud
                string localFilePath = @"C:\Path\To\Your\Local\File.vsdx";  // Source file on local disk
                bool isOverwrite = true;  // Set to true to overwrite if file exists
                
                // Upload the file
                using (var fileStream = File.OpenRead(localFilePath))
                {
                    var response = diagramApi.PutUpload(remoteFilename, fileStream, isOverwrite);
                    
                    // Check result
                    if (response.Status == "OK")
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine($"File '{remoteFilename}' uploaded successfully!");
                        
                        // Optionally, verify by getting diagram info
                        var diagramInfo = diagramApi.GetDiagram(remoteFilename);
                        Console.WriteLine("Verification successful - diagram info retrieved.");
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine($"Failed to upload file. Status: {response.Status}");
                    }
                }
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                Debug.Print("Exception when uploading file: " + e.Message);
                Console.WriteLine("Error occurred: " + e.Message);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

            String localFilePath = "C:\\Path\\To\\Your\\Local\\File.vsdx";  // Source file on local disk
            Boolean isOverwrite = true;  // Set to true to overwrite if file exists
            
            // Upload the file
            File file = new File(localFilePath);
            FileInputStream fileStream = new FileInputStream(file);
            
            ResultResponse response = diagramApi.putUpload(remoteFilename, fileStream, isOverwrite);
            
            // Check result
            if (response.getStatus().equals("OK")) {
                System.out.println("File '" + remoteFilename + "' uploaded successfully!");
                
                // Optionally, verify by getting diagram info
                DiagramResponse diagramInfo = diagramApi.getDiagram(remoteFilename, null, null);
                System.out.println("Verification successful - diagram info retrieved.");
            } else {
                System.out.println("Failed to upload file. Status: " + response.getStatus());
            }
            
            // Clean up
            fileStream.close();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Python Example

```python
import asposediagramcloud
from asposediagramcloud.apis.diagram_file_api import DiagramFileApi
from asposediagramcloud.api_client import ApiClient
from asposediagramcloud.configuration import Configuration

# Configure API key authorization
configuration = Configuration(
    client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
)

# Create API instance
api_instance = DiagramFileApi(ApiClient(configuration))

try:
    # Set the upload parameters
    remote_filename = "mydrawing.vsdx"  # Destination filename in cloud
    local_file_path = "C:\\Path\\To\\Your\\Local\\File.vsdx"  # Source file on local disk
    is_overwrite = True  # Set to True to overwrite if file exists
    
    # Upload the file
    with open(local_file_path, 'rb') as file_stream:
        response = api_instance.put_upload(remote_filename, file_stream, is_overwrite)
    
    # Check result
    if response.status == "OK":
        print(f"File '{remote_filename}' uploaded successfully!")
        
        # Optionally, verify by getting diagram info
        diagram_info = api_instance.get_diagram(remote_filename)
        print("Verification successful - diagram info retrieved.")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to upload file. Status: {response.status}")
        
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Exception when uploading file: {e}")
```

### 5. Working with Large Files

When uploading large diagram files, consider the following best practices:

1. Implement retry logic: Network issues can occur during uploads; your code should handle retries.
2. Use chunked upload: For very large files, consider splitting the upload into smaller chunks.
3. Verify upload completion: Always verify that the entire file was uploaded correctly.
4. Handle timeouts: Increase timeout settings for large file uploads.

## Try It Yourself

Now it's your turn! Follow these steps to practice what you've learned:

1. Select a Visio diagram file from your local system
2. Use one of the examples above to upload it to your Aspose Cloud Storage
3. Verify the upload by retrieving information about the diagram
4. Try uploading files of different sizes and formats to understand any variations in behavior

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- Authentication errors: Double-check your Client ID and Client Secret
- File not found errors: Ensure the local file path is correct
- Permission errors: Verify you have read access to the local file
- Timeout errors: For large files, consider implementing chunked uploads
- Overwrite errors: Use the `isOverwrite` parameter to control file replacement behavior

## What You've Learned

In this tutorial, you've learned how to:
- Upload diagram files to Aspose.Diagram Cloud storage
- Use different upload methods depending on your requirements
- Verify successful file uploads
- Implement file upload functionality in multiple programming languages
