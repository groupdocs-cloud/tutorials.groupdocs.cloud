---

## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to delete images from a search context in Aspose.Imaging Cloud's Reverse Image Search API. As you manage your image databases, you'll often need to remove specific images that are no longer relevant or needed. This tutorial will guide you through the proper procedure to delete both the image and its associated features from your search context.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have:

1. An Aspose.Cloud account with an active subscription or trial
2. Your application credentials (Client ID and Client Secret)
3. An existing search context with at least one image added
4. Basic understanding of RESTful API calls
5. Your preferred programming environment set up (Java, .NET, etc.)

## Understanding Image Deletion

When you delete an image from a search context:
- Both the original image data and its extracted features are removed
- The image will no longer appear in search results
- This operation cannot be undone

This tutorial covers the complete deletion of an image, rather than just removing its features (which is covered in a separate tutorial).

## When to Delete Images

You might want to delete images from your search context when:
- The image is outdated or no longer relevant
- You need to remove duplicates or low-quality images
- You're cleaning up your search context to optimize storage
- You want to exclude certain images from all future searches

## Tutorial Steps

### Step 1: Authenticate with the API

First, obtain an access token:

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/oauth2/token" \
-X POST \
-d 'grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET' \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-H "Accept: application/json"
```

Save the returned access token for use in the next steps.

### Step 2: Delete an Image from Search Context

To delete an image, you'll need:
- Your search context ID
- The image ID you want to delete

Use the following API call:

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3/imaging/ai/imageSearch/YOUR_SEARCH_CONTEXT_ID/image?imageId=YOUR_IMAGE_ID" \
-X DELETE \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

Replace `YOUR_SEARCH_CONTEXT_ID` with your context ID and `YOUR_IMAGE_ID` with the ID of the image you want to delete.

### Step 3: Verify the Deletion

A successful deletion will return a response like this:

```json
{
  "Code": 200,
  "Status": "OK"
}
```

To confirm that the image was truly deleted, you can try to retrieve it:

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3/imaging/ai/imageSearch/YOUR_SEARCH_CONTEXT_ID/image?imageId=YOUR_IMAGE_ID" \
-X GET \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

You should receive an error indicating the image does not exist.

Try it yourself: Execute these commands with your own credentials and parameters to verify the image has been successfully deleted.

### Step 4: Implement Using SDK (Java Example)

For programmatic image deletion, you can use the Java SDK:

```java
// Import required classes
import com.aspose.imaging.cloud.sdk.api.ImagingApi;
import com.aspose.imaging.cloud.sdk.model.SearchContextStatus;

public class DeleteImageFromSearchContext {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Create imaging API client
            ImagingApi imagingApi = new ImagingApi("YOUR_CLIENT_ID", "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET");
            
            // Specify the search context ID and image ID
            String searchContextId = "YOUR_SEARCH_CONTEXT_ID";
            String imageId = "YOUR_IMAGE_ID";
            
            // Delete the image and its features
            SearchContextStatus status = imagingApi.deleteSearchImage(searchContextId, imageId, null);
            
            System.out.println("Status: " + status.getStatus());
            
            // Verify the image is deleted by trying to retrieve it
            try {
                byte[] imageBytes = imagingApi.getSearchImage(searchContextId, imageId, null);
                System.out.println("Image still exists (unexpected)");
            } catch (Exception e) {
                System.out.println("Image successfully deleted: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Error deleting image: " + e.getMessage());
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Implement Using SDK (.NET Example)

Here's how to delete an image using the .NET SDK:

```csharp
// Import required namespaces
using Aspose.Imaging.Cloud.Sdk.Api;
using Aspose.Imaging.Cloud.Sdk.Model;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        try
        {
            // Create imaging API client
            ImagingApi imagingApi = new ImagingApi("YOUR_CLIENT_ID", "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET");
            
            // Specify the search context ID and image ID
            string searchContextId = "YOUR_SEARCH_CONTEXT_ID";
            string imageId = "YOUR_IMAGE_ID";
            
            // Delete the image and its features
            SearchContextStatus status = imagingApi.DeleteSearchImage(searchContextId, imageId);
            
            Console.WriteLine($"Status: {status.Status}");
            
            // Verify the image is deleted by trying to retrieve it
            try
            {
                byte[] imageBytes = imagingApi.GetSearchImage(searchContextId, imageId);
                Console.WriteLine("Image still exists (unexpected)");
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Image successfully deleted: {ex.Message}");
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Error deleting image: {ex.Message}");
        }
    }
}
```

## Use Cases for Image Deletion

1. Content moderation: Remove inappropriate or outdated images
2. Storage optimization: Delete unnecessary images to reduce storage costs
3. Data privacy: Remove images that contain sensitive information
4. Database cleanup: Remove low-quality or duplicate images

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. Image Not Found
   - Problem: 404 Not Found response when trying to delete
   - Solution: Verify the image ID is correct and that it exists in the search context

2. Authentication Error
   - Problem: 401 Unauthorized response
   - Solution: Check that your access token is valid and hasn't expired

3. Permission Issues
   - Problem: 403 Forbidden response
   - Solution: Ensure your account has sufficient permissions to perform deletion operations
