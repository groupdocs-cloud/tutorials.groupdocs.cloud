# Tutorial: Learn the Text to Speech Basics

## Learning Objectives

In this tutorial, you'll learn:
- What text-to-speech (TTS) conversion is and how it works
- How Aspose.OCR Cloud implements TTS functionality
- The basic workflow for converting text to speech using API calls
- Key concepts like queuing, task IDs, and response handling

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial:
- No programming experience required for this introduction
- Basic understanding of REST APIs and HTTP methods is helpful
- A free Aspose Cloud account ([sign up here](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps))

## What is Text to Speech?

Text-to-speech (TTS) is a technology that converts written text into spoken words. The Aspose.OCR Cloud API extends beyond traditional optical character recognition to offer TTS capabilities, enabling applications to:

- Convert extracted text from images into natural-sounding speech
- Make content more accessible for users with visual impairments
- Create audio versions of written content for multitasking
- Enhance user experience with audio feedback

## The Aspose.OCR Cloud TTS Workflow

The Aspose.OCR Cloud API implements a three-step workflow for text-to-speech conversion:

1. Authorization - Obtain an access token to authenticate your API requests
2. Text Submission - Send the text you want to convert to speech
3. Result Retrieval - Fetch the generated audio file

Let's explore each step in detail:

### Step 1: Authentication

Before using the TTS features, you must authenticate with the Aspose.OCR Cloud API. This is done by obtaining an access token:

```
POST https://api.aspose.cloud/connect/token
```

The token is then used in subsequent API calls in the Authorization header.

Try it yourself: Create a free Aspose Cloud account and generate your first access token in the dashboard.

### Step 2: Text Submission

When submitting text for conversion:

1. The API endpoint accepts a POST request with your text and conversion settings
2. The text is placed in a processing queue
3. A unique task ID is returned for tracking your request

```
POST https://api.aspose.cloud/v5.0/ocr/converttexttospeech
```

The request body includes:
- The text to be converted
- Language settings (currently English only)
- The desired output format (currently WAV only)

### Step 3: Result Retrieval

The final step is fetching the generated audio:

1. Use the task ID from step 2 to check the status and retrieve results
2. The audio file is returned as a Base64-encoded string
3. Decode the Base64 string to get the actual audio file

```
GET https://api.aspose.cloud/v5.0/ocr/converttexttospeech?id={task-id}
```

> Note: TTS conversion results are stored in the Aspose cloud for 24 hours after submission.

## Understanding Task Statuses

When retrieving your TTS results, the API returns a status indicating where your request is in the processing pipeline:

- Pending - In queue, but not yet processed
- Processing - Currently being converted
- Completed - Conversion is finished
- Error - An error occurred during conversion
- NotExist - The task ID is invalid or results were deleted

## Hands-on Practice

Now that you understand the basic concepts, let's try a simple exercise:

1. Write down a short paragraph (2-3 sentences) that you'd like to convert to speech
2. Identify the three API calls you would need to make to convert it
3. Think about how you would handle each potential task status

This exercise will help you understand the workflow before diving into actual code implementation.

## What You've Learned

In this tutorial, you've learned:
- The basic concept of text-to-speech conversion
- Aspose.OCR Cloud's three-step TTS workflow
- How the queueing system works for processing TTS requests
- Different task statuses and their meanings

## Next Steps

Ready to implement your first TTS conversion? Continue to the next tutorial: [Tutorial: How to Send Text for Speech Conversion](/text-to-speech/send-text/) where you'll learn to write code that submits text to the Aspose.OCR Cloud API.

## Further Practice

To reinforce your understanding:
- Explore the Aspose.OCR Cloud API documentation
- Consider different use cases for TTS in your own applications
- Think about how you would integrate TTS with OCR for a complete solution
