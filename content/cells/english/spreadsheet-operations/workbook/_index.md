# Tutorial: How to Create an Excel Workbook with Aspose.Cells Cloud API

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have:
- An Aspose Cloud account with an active subscription or free trial
- Your Client ID and Client Secret from the [Aspose Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/)
- Basic understanding of REST API concepts
- Familiarity with your preferred programming language (examples provided in multiple languages)

## Understanding Workbook Creation

Creating Excel workbooks programmatically is often the first step in many spreadsheet automation workflows. Aspose.Cells Cloud API provides multiple ways to create workbooks:

1. Creating empty workbooks
2. Creating workbooks from templates
3. Creating workbooks with Smart Markers

Let's explore each approach step by step.

## 1. Creating an Empty Excel Workbook

The simplest way to generate a new Excel file is to create an empty workbook. This gives you a blank canvas to populate with your data.

### Try It Yourself: Creating an Empty Workbook

Follow these steps to create your first empty workbook:

1. Prepare your authentication credentials
2. Make the API request to create an empty workbook
3. Verify the created workbook

### Using cURL

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/cells/newworkbook.xlsx?isWriteOver=false" \
-H "accept: application/json" \
-H "authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### SDK Examples

Let's see how to create an empty workbook using different programming languages:

#### Python

```python
# Tutorial Code Example - Creating an Empty Excel Workbook
import asposecellscloud
from asposecellscloud.apis.cells_api import CellsApi
from asposecellscloud.models import *
from asposecellscloud.requests import *

# Configure authentication
client_id = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
client_secret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
api = CellsApi(client_id, client_secret)

# Specify the name for the new workbook
name = "new_workbook.xlsx"

# Create a request to generate an empty workbook
request = PutWorkbookCreateRequest(name=name, is_write_over=True)

# Execute the request
response = api.put_workbook_create(request)

# Check if the workbook was created successfully
if response.status == "OK":
    print(f"Success! Empty workbook '{name}' created.")
    print(f"Workbook properties: {response.workbook}")
else:
    print(f"Error creating workbook: {response.status}")
```

#### C#

```csharp
// Tutorial Code Example - Creating an Empty Excel Workbook
using System;
using Aspose.Cells.Cloud.SDK.Api;
using Aspose.Cells.Cloud.SDK.Model;
using Aspose.Cells.Cloud.SDK.Request;

namespace AsposeCellsCloudTutorial
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Configure authentication
            var clientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID";
            var clientSecret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET";
            var api = new CellsApi(clientId, clientSecret);
            
            // Specify the name for the new workbook
            var name = "new_workbook.xlsx";
            
            // Create a request to generate an empty workbook
            var request = new PutWorkbookCreateRequest
            {
                Name = name,
                IsWriteOver = true
            };
            
            try
            {
                // Execute the request
                var response = api.PutWorkbookCreate(request);
                
                // Check if the workbook was created successfully
                Console.WriteLine($"Success! Empty workbook '{name}' created.");
                Console.WriteLine($"Workbook properties: {response.Workbook}");
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Error creating workbook: {ex.Message}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Java

```java
// Tutorial Code Example - Creating an Empty Excel Workbook
import com.aspose.cells.cloud.api.CellsApi;
import com.aspose.cells.cloud.model.*;
import com.aspose.cells.cloud.request.*;

public class CreateEmptyWorkbook {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Configure authentication
        String clientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID";
        String clientSecret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET";
        CellsApi api = new CellsApi(clientId, clientSecret);
        
        try {
            // Specify the name for the new workbook
            String name = "new_workbook.xlsx";
            
            // Create a request to generate an empty workbook
            PutWorkbookCreateRequest request = new PutWorkbookCreateRequest();
            request.setName(name);
            request.setIsWriteOver(true);
            
            // Execute the request
            WorkbookResponse response = api.putWorkbookCreate(request);
            
            // Check if the workbook was created successfully
            System.out.println("Success! Empty workbook '" + name + "' created.");
            System.out.println("Workbook properties: " + response.getWorkbook());
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Error creating workbook: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

## 2. Creating a Workbook from a Template

For more structured workbooks, you can create files based on existing templates. This is useful when you need consistent formatting or predefined formulas.

### Try It Yourself: Creating a Workbook from a Template

1. First, upload your template file to Aspose.Cells Cloud storage
2. Then create a new workbook based on that template
3. Verify the created workbook contains all elements from the template

### Using cURL

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/cells/newworkbook.xlsx?templateFile=template.xlsx&isWriteOver=true" \
-H "accept: application/json" \
-H "authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### Python Example

```python
# Tutorial Code Example - Creating a Workbook from Template
import asposecellscloud
from asposecellscloud.apis.cells_api import CellsApi
from asposecellscloud.models import *
from asposecellscloud.requests import *

# Configure authentication
client_id = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
client_secret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
api = CellsApi(client_id, client_secret)

# Specify file names
template_file = "template.xlsx"
new_workbook = "from_template.xlsx"

# Create a request to generate a workbook from template
request = PutWorkbookCreateRequest(
    name=new_workbook, 
    template_file=template_file,
    is_write_over=True
)

# Execute the request
response = api.put_workbook_create(request)

# Check if the workbook was created successfully
if response.status == "OK":
    print(f"Success! Workbook '{new_workbook}' created from template '{template_file}'.")
else:
    print(f"Error creating workbook: {response.status}")
```

## 3. Creating a Workbook with Smart Markers

Smart Markers are a powerful feature that allows you to create data-populated workbooks. They act as placeholders in your template that get replaced with actual data.

### Try It Yourself: Using Smart Markers

1. Create a template file with Smart Markers
2. Prepare your data file (typically XML)
3. Use the API to process the template with data

### Smart Marker Example

```python
# Tutorial Code Example - Creating a Workbook with Smart Markers
import asposecellscloud
from asposecellscloud.apis.cells_api import CellsApi
from asposecellscloud.models import *
from asposecellscloud.requests import *

# Configure authentication
client_id = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
client_secret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
api = CellsApi(client_id, client_secret)

# Specify file names
workbook_name = "smartmarker_template.xlsx"
xml_file = "Sample_SmartMarker_Data.xml"

# Create request to process Smart Markers
request = PostWorkbookGetSmartMarkerResultRequest(
    name=workbook_name,
    xml_file=xml_file
)

# Execute the request
response = api.post_workbook_get_smart_marker_result(request)

# The processed file is returned in the response
if response is not None:
    print("Success! Smart Marker template processed with data.")
    # You can save the response.body to a file
else:
    print("Error processing Smart Marker template.")
```

## Troubleshooting Tips

When creating workbooks, you might encounter these common issues:

1. Authentication errors:
   - Ensure your Client ID and Secret are correct
   - Check that your access token is valid and not expired

2. File already exists:
   - Set `isWriteOver=false` to prevent overwriting existing files
   - Or set `isWriteOver=true` to replace existing files

3. Template file not found:
   - Verify the template file exists in your storage
   - Check that the path to the template file is correct

4. Smart Marker processing errors:
   - Ensure your XML data format matches the Smart Markers in the template
   - Verify that Smart Markers in the template are correctly formatted
