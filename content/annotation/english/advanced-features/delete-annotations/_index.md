# Tutorial: How to Delete Annotations from Documents

## Learning Objectives

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:
- Remove specific annotations from documents by their IDs
- Create a workflow for annotation management
- Implement annotation deletion in different programming languages
- Handle annotation deletion responses and error scenarios

## What is Annotation Deletion?

Annotation deletion allows you to remove one or more specific annotations from a document while preserving others. This is useful for cleaning up documents, implementing approval workflows, or removing outdated feedback.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:
1. A GroupDocs.Annotation Cloud account (or [get a free trial](https://dashboard.groupdocs.cloud/#/apps)
2. Your Client ID and Client Secret credentials
3. A development environment for your preferred language
4. An annotated document uploaded to your GroupDocs.Annotation Cloud storage
5. Knowledge of annotation IDs you want to delete (using the Extract Annotations API)

## Implementation Steps

Let's walk through the process of deleting specific annotations from a document:

### 1. Authentication

First, authenticate with the GroupDocs.Annotation Cloud API:

```javascript
// Get JWT token
curl -v "https://api.groupdocs.cloud/connect/token" \
-X POST \
-d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-H "Accept: application/json"
```

Save the received JWT token for subsequent API calls.

### 2. Identify Annotation IDs to Delete

Before deleting annotations, you need to know their IDs. You can get these by using the Extract Annotations endpoint:

```javascript
// Get annotation IDs
curl -v "https://api.groupdocs.cloud/v2.0/annotation/extract" \
-X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
-d "{ \"FilePath\": \"annotated-document.docx\"}"
```

From the response, note the IDs of the annotations you want to delete.

### 3. Delete Specific Annotations

Use the `POST /annotation/remove` endpoint to delete the annotations:

```javascript
// Delete annotations
curl -v "https://api.groupdocs.cloud/v2.0/annotation/remove" \
-X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
-d "{ 
  \"FileInfo\": { 
    \"FilePath\": \"annotated-document.docx\" 
  }, 
  \"AnnotationIds\": [1, 2, 3], 
  \"OutputPath\": \"output/cleaned-document.docx\"
}"
```

### 4. Download the Updated Document

After successful deletion, download your updated document using the File API.

## Try It Yourself

Now, let's implement annotation deletion in different programming languages.

### C# Example

```csharp
// For complete examples, visit: https://github.com/groupdocs-annotation-cloud/groupdocs-annotation-cloud-dotnet-samples
string MyAppKey = "YOUR_APP_KEY"; // Get AppKey and AppSID from https://dashboard.groupdocs.cloud
string MyAppSid = "YOUR_APP_SID";

var configuration = new Configuration(MyAppSid, MyAppKey);
var apiInstance = new AnnotateApi(configuration);

var fileInfo = new FileInfo { FilePath = "annotated-document.docx" };

// First, extract annotations to get their IDs
var extractedAnnotations = apiInstance.Extract(new ExtractRequest(fileInfo));
Console.WriteLine("Found annotations: " + extractedAnnotations.Count);

// For this example, let's delete the first 2 annotations
var annotationIdsToDelete = extractedAnnotations
    .Take(2)
    .Select(a => a.Id)
    .ToList();

Console.WriteLine("Deleting annotation IDs: " + string.Join(", ", annotationIdsToDelete));

// Create delete options
var options = new RemoveOptions
{
    FileInfo = fileInfo,
    AnnotationIds = annotationIdsToDelete,
    OutputPath = "output/cleaned-document.docx"
};

// Delete the annotations
var link = apiInstance.RemoveAnnotations(new RemoveAnnotationsRequest(options));
Console.WriteLine("Annotations deleted, updated document saved at: " + link.Title);
```

### Java Example

```java
// For complete examples, visit: https://github.com/groupdocs-annotation-cloud/groupdocs-annotation-cloud-java-samples
String clientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"; // Get ClientId and ClientSecret from https://dashboard.groupdocs.cloud
String clientSecret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET";

Configuration configuration = new Configuration(clientId, clientSecret);
AnnotateApi apiInstance = new AnnotateApi(configuration);

// Create file info object
FileInfo fileInfo = new FileInfo();
fileInfo.setFilePath("annotated-document.docx");

// First, extract annotations to get their IDs
List<AnnotationInfo> extractedAnnotations = apiInstance.extract(new ExtractRequest(fileInfo));
System.out.println("Found annotations: " + extractedAnnotations.size());

// For this example, let's delete the first 2 annotations
List<Integer> annotationIdsToDelete = new ArrayList<>();
for (int i = 0; i < Math.min(2, extractedAnnotations.size()); i++) {
    annotationIdsToDelete.add(extractedAnnotations.get(i).getId());
}

System.out.println("Deleting annotation IDs: " + String.join(", ", 
    annotationIdsToDelete.stream().map(String::valueOf).collect(Collectors.toList())));

// Create delete options
RemoveOptions options = new RemoveOptions();
options.setFileInfo(fileInfo);
options.setAnnotationIds(annotationIdsToDelete);
options.setOutputPath("output/cleaned-document.docx");

// Delete the annotations
AnnotationApiLink link = apiInstance.removeAnnotations(new RemoveAnnotationsRequest(options));
System.out.println("Annotations deleted, updated document saved at: " + link.getTitle());
```

### Python Example

```python
# For complete examples, visit: https://github.com/groupdocs-annotation-cloud/groupdocs-annotation-cloud-python-samples
import groupdocs_annotation_cloud

app_sid = "YOUR_APP_SID"  # Get AppKey and AppSID from https://dashboard.groupdocs.cloud
app_key = "YOUR_APP_KEY"

api = groupdocs_annotation_cloud.AnnotateApi.from_keys(app_sid, app_key)

# Set up file info for the annotated document
file_info = groupdocs_annotation_cloud.FileInfo()
file_info.file_path = "annotated-document.docx"

# First, extract annotations to get their IDs
extracted_annotations = api.extract(groupdocs_annotation_cloud.ExtractRequest(file_info))
print(f"Found annotations: {len(extracted_annotations)}")

# For this example, let's delete the first 2 annotations
annotation_ids_to_delete = [ann.id for ann in extracted_annotations[:2]]
print(f"Deleting annotation IDs: {', '.join(map(str, annotation_ids_to_delete))}")

# Create delete options
options = groupdocs_annotation_cloud.RemoveOptions()
options.file_info = file_info
options.annotation_ids = annotation_ids_to_delete
options.output_path = "output/cleaned-document.docx"

# Delete the annotations
request = groupdocs_annotation_cloud.RemoveAnnotationsRequest(options)
result = api.remove_annotations(request)

print(f"Annotations deleted, updated document saved at: {result.title}")
```

## Advanced Annotation Deletion Workflows

Here are some common workflow patterns for annotation deletion:

### 1. Approval-Based Cleanup

Delete annotations after they've been processed in an approval workflow:

```python
# Pseudocode for approval workflow
for annotation in extracted_annotations:
    if annotation.text.startswith("[APPROVED]"):
        # Process approval logic here
        
        # Delete the approval annotation after processing
        annotation_ids_to_delete.append(annotation.id)
        
# Delete processed annotations
delete_annotations(annotation_ids_to_delete)
```

### 2. Batched Deletion

For documents with many annotations, you may want to delete them in batches:

```csharp
// Pseudocode for batch deletion
List<int> allAnnotationIds = extractedAnnotations.Select(a => a.Id).ToList();
int batchSize = 10;

for (int i = 0; i < allAnnotationIds.Count; i += batchSize)
{
    List<int> batch = allAnnotationIds
        .Skip(i)
        .Take(batchSize)
        .ToList();
        
    // Delete the current batch
    DeleteAnnotations(batch);
}
```

### 3. Selective Deletion by User

Delete annotations from specific users:

```java
// Pseudocode for user-specific deletion
String userToRemove = "John Doe";
List<Integer> userAnnotationIds = new ArrayList<>();

for (AnnotationInfo annotation : extractedAnnotations) {
    if (userToRemove.equals(annotation.getCreatorName())) {
        userAnnotationIds.add(annotation.getId());
    }
}

// Delete all annotations from this user
DeleteAnnotations(userAnnotationIds);
```

### 4. Deletion by Annotation Type

Delete annotations of a specific type:

```python
# Pseudocode for type-specific deletion
annotation_type_to_remove = "TextHighlight"
type_annotation_ids = []

for annotation in extracted_annotations:
    if annotation.type == annotation_type_to_remove:
        type_annotation_ids.append(annotation.id)

# Delete all annotations of this type
delete_annotations(type_annotation_ids)
```

## Troubleshooting Tips

1. Invalid Annotation IDs: Make sure the annotation IDs you're trying to delete actually exist in the document
2. Document Not Found: Verify that the input file path is correct
3. Permission Issues: Ensure you have write permissions for the output file path
4. No Changes: If the document isn't changed, ensure that the annotation IDs are correct and that the document contains those annotations

## What You've Learned

In this tutorial, you've learned how to:
- Extract annotation IDs from documents
- Delete specific annotations based on their IDs
- Create efficient annotation deletion workflows
- Handle annotation deletion in different programming languages

## Further Practice

To enhance your understanding of annotation deletion, try these exercises:
1. Create a UI that displays annotations and allows selective deletion
2. Implement a time-based cleanup system that removes annotations older than a specific date
3. Build a workflow that automatically cleans up resolved comment threads
4. Develop a system that archives annotations before deleting them from documents
