# Tutorial: Working with Files and Storage for Diagram Conversion

## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll learn essential file and storage operations that support diagram conversion workflows using Aspose.Diagram Cloud API. Understanding how to manage files in cloud storage is critical for efficient diagram processing and conversion.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:
- Download files from Aspose Cloud Storage
- Copy files to new locations
- Move files within your storage
- Delete files when they're no longer needed
- Implement complete file management workflows for diagram conversion

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have:
- An Aspose Cloud account ([get a free trial here](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps))
- Your Client ID and Client Secret from the [Aspose Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/)
- Completed the previous tutorials, especially on uploading files (recommended)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Authentication

As with all Aspose.Diagram Cloud operations, start by authenticating to get an access token.

#### Using cURL

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/connect/token" \
-X POST \
-d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-H "Accept: application/json"
```

The response will include an access token:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGci...",
  "expires_in": 86400,
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

### 2. Downloading a File from Cloud Storage

After you've converted a diagram file, you'll often need to download it for local use.

#### Using cURL

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/diagram/storage/file/converted_diagram.pdf" \
-X GET \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
--output "local_download.pdf"
```

Replace:
- `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your authentication token
- `converted_diagram.pdf` with the file you want to download
- `local_download.pdf` with your desired local filename

This command will download the file to your local system with the specified name.

### 3. Copying a File to a New Location

Sometimes you need to keep the original file and work with a copy, especially when experimenting with different conversion settings.

#### Using cURL

```bash
curl -v -X PUT "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/diagram/storage/file/copy/source_diagram.vsdx" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
-d '{"destPath": "backup/source_diagram_copy.vsdx"}'
```

Replace:
- `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your authentication token
- `source_diagram.vsdx` with the file you want to copy
- `backup/source_diagram_copy.vsdx` with the destination path and filename

### 4. Moving a File to a New Location

After conversion, you might want to organize files by moving them to different folders.

#### Using cURL

```bash
curl -v -X PUT "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/diagram/storage/file/move/converted_diagram.pdf" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
-d '{"destPath": "completed/converted_diagram.pdf"}'
```

Replace:
- `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your authentication token
- `converted_diagram.pdf` with the file you want to move
- `completed/converted_diagram.pdf` with the destination path and filename

### 5. Deleting a File from Cloud Storage

To manage your storage efficiently, you'll want to delete temporary or unneeded files.

#### Using cURL

```bash
curl -v -X DELETE "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/diagram/storage/file/temp_diagram.vsdx" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

Replace:
- `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your authentication token
- `temp_diagram.vsdx` with the file you want to delete

### 6. Implementing with SDKs

While the examples above use cURL for clarity, in real applications, you'll likely use one of the Aspose.Diagram Cloud SDKs. Here's how to implement these operations using the SDKs:

#### C# Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Diagnostics;
using Aspose.Diagram.Cloud.Sdk.Api;
using Aspose.Diagram.Cloud.Sdk.Model;

namespace DiagramTutorials
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Configure API key authorization
            var config = new Configuration
            {
                ClientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
                ClientSecret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" 
            };

            // Create DiagramFileApi instance
            var diagramApi = new DiagramFileApi(config);
            
            // Create FileApi instance for file operations
            var fileApi = new FileApi(config);
            
            try
            {
                // Download a file
                string remoteFilePath = "converted_diagram.pdf";
                var fileStream = fileApi.DownloadFile(remoteFilePath);
                using (var localFileStream = File.Create("local_download.pdf"))
                {
                    fileStream.CopyTo(localFileStream);
                }
                Console.WriteLine("File downloaded successfully!");
                
                // Copy a file
                string srcPath = "source_diagram.vsdx";
                string destPath = "backup/source_diagram_copy.vsdx";
                fileApi.CopyFile(srcPath, destPath);
                Console.WriteLine("File copied successfully!");
                
                // Move a file
                srcPath = "converted_diagram.pdf";
                destPath = "completed/converted_diagram.pdf";
                fileApi.MoveFile(srcPath, destPath);
                Console.WriteLine("File moved successfully!");
                
                // Delete a file
                string fileToDelete = "temp_diagram.vsdx";
                fileApi.DeleteFile(fileToDelete);
                Console.WriteLine("File deleted successfully!");
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                Debug.Print("Exception during file operations: " + e.Message);
                Console.WriteLine("Error occurred: " + e.Message);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```java
import com.aspose.diagram.cloud.api.DiagramFileApi;
import com.aspose.diagram.cloud.api.FileApi;
import com.aspose.diagram.cloud.auth.*;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.InputStream;

public class FileStorageTutorial {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Configure API credentials
            ApiClient apiClient = new ApiClient();
            apiClient.setClientId("YOUR_CLIENT_ID");
            apiClient.setClientSecret("YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET");
            
            // Create FileApi instance for file operations
            FileApi fileApi = new FileApi(apiClient);
            
            // Download a file
            String remoteFilePath = "converted_diagram.pdf";
            byte[] fileBytes = fileApi.downloadFile(remoteFilePath);
            
            // Save to local file
            FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream("local_download.pdf");
            outputStream.write(fileBytes);
            outputStream.close();
            System.out.println("File downloaded successfully!");
            
            // Copy a file
            String srcPath = "source_diagram.vsdx";
            String destPath = "backup/source_diagram_copy.vsdx";
            fileApi.copyFile(srcPath, destPath, null, null);
            System.out.println("File copied successfully!");
            
            // Move a file
            srcPath = "converted_diagram.pdf";
            destPath = "completed/converted_diagram.pdf";
            fileApi.moveFile(srcPath, destPath, null, null);
            System.out.println("File moved successfully!");
            
            // Delete a file
            String fileToDelete = "temp_diagram.vsdx";
            fileApi.deleteFile(fileToDelete, null, null);
            System.out.println("File deleted successfully!");
            
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Python Example

```python
import asposediagramcloud
from asposediagramcloud.apis.diagram_file_api import DiagramFileApi
from asposediagramcloud.apis.file_api import FileApi
from asposediagramcloud.api_client import ApiClient

configuration = Configuration(
    client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
)

# Create API instances
api_client = ApiClient(configuration)
file_api = FileApi(api_client)

try:
    # Download a file
    remote_file_path = "converted_diagram.pdf"
    response = file_api.download_file(remote_file_path)
    
    # Save to local file
    with open("local_download.pdf", 'wb') as f:
        f.write(response)

    file_api.delete_file(file_to_delete)
    print("File deleted successfully!")
    
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Exception during file operations: {e}")
```

### 7. Complete Diagram Conversion Workflow

Let's put everything together in a complete workflow:

1. Upload a diagram file
2. Make a backup copy of the original file
3. Convert the diagram to a different format
4. Download the converted file
5. Move the converted file to an organized location
6. Delete any temporary files

Here's how this workflow would look in Python:

```python
import asposediagramcloud
from asposediagramcloud.apis.diagram_file_api import DiagramFileApi
from asposediagramcloud.apis.file_api import FileApi
from asposediagramcloud.api_client import ApiClient
from asposediagramcloud.configuration import Configuration
from asposediagramcloud.models.save_as_request import SaveAsRequest

# Configure API key authorization
configuration = Configuration(
    client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
)

# Create API instances
api_client = ApiClient(configuration)
diagram_api = DiagramFileApi(api_client)
file_api = FileApi(api_client)

try:
    # 1. Upload the diagram file
    source_filename = "source_diagram.vsdx"
    local_file_path = "C:\\Path\\To\\Your\\Local\\File.vsdx"
    is_overwrite = True
    
    with open(local_file_path, 'rb') as file_stream:
        upload_response = diagram_api.put_upload(source_filename, file_stream, is_overwrite)
    
    print(f"File '{source_filename}' uploaded successfully!")
    
    # 2. Make a backup copy
    backup_filename = "backup/source_diagram_backup.vsdx"
    file_api.copy_file(source_filename, backup_filename)
    print(f"Backup created at '{backup_filename}'")
    
    # 3. Convert the diagram
    output_filename = "converted_diagram.pdf"
    save_as_request = SaveAsRequest(format="pdf")
    
    conversion_response = diagram_api.post_save_as(
        source_filename, save_as_request, output_filename, is_overwrite)
    
    print(f"Diagram converted successfully to '{output_filename}'")
    
    # 4. Download the converted file
    response = file_api.download_file(output_filename)
    
    # Save to local file
    with open("local_" + output_filename, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(response)
    print(f"Converted file downloaded to 'local_{output_filename}'")
    
    # 5. Move the converted file to an organized location
    organized_path = "completed/" + output_filename
    file_api.move_file(output_filename, organized_path)
    print(f"Converted file moved to '{organized_path}'")
    
    # 6. Delete any temporary files (if applicable)
    # For example, if you created any intermediate files during the process
    # file_api.delete_file("temp_file.tmp")
    # print("Temporary files cleaned up")
    
    print("Complete diagram conversion workflow executed successfully!")
    
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Exception during workflow: {e}")
```

## Common File Management Patterns

Here are some common file management patterns you might find useful when working with diagram conversion:

### 1. Working with Different Storage Providers

Aspose.Diagram Cloud supports various storage providers. You can specify which storage to use:

```python
# Specify storage name in operations
file_api.download_file(remote_file_path, storage="MyAzureStorage")
```

### 2. Creating Directories

You may need to create directories to organize your files:

```python
# Create a directory
folder_api = FolderApi(api_client)
folder_api.create_folder("my/new/folder")
```

### 3. Checking if Files Exist

Before operations, you might want to check if files exist:

```python
# Check if file exists
exists_response = file_api.object_exists("myfile.vsdx")
if exists_response.exists:
    print("File exists!")
else:
    print("File does not exist!")
```

### 4. Listing Files in a Directory

To manage your files efficiently, you might need to list files in a directory:

```python
# List files in a directory
files = file_api.get_files_list("my/diagrams/folder")
for file_info in files.value:
    print(f"File: {file_info.name}, Size: {file_info.size} bytes")
```

## Try It Yourself

Now it's your turn! Follow these steps to practice what you've learned:

1. Implement the complete diagram conversion workflow
2. Experiment with copying, moving, and deleting files
3. Create a directory structure to organize your diagram files
4. List files in a directory to verify operations
5. Check if files exist before performing operations

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- Authentication errors: Double-check your Client ID and Client Secret
- File not found errors: Ensure paths are correct and files exist
- Directory structure errors: Create parent directories before using nested paths
- Path format issues: Use forward slashes (/) in paths, even on Windows systems
- Permission issues: Verify you have appropriate permissions on the storage
