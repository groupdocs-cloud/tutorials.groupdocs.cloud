# Tutorial: How to Convert Presentations to Different Formats

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, you should:

1. Have an [Aspose Cloud account](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) with active credentials
2. Be familiar with making REST API calls
3. Have your preferred development environment set up (for SDK examples)
4. Have completed the [Creating Presentations tutorial](/working-with-documents/create-new-presentation/) or have equivalent knowledge

## Introduction

Converting presentations between different formats is a common requirement for many business applications. Whether you need to distribute presentations as PDFs, display them as HTML, or extract slides as images, Aspose.Slides Cloud API provides flexible conversion options.

In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate how to convert presentations to different formats using various methods, depending on your source and destination requirements.

## Understanding Available Formats

Aspose.Slides Cloud API supports converting presentations to the following formats:

| File Type | Extension |
| --- | --- |
| Portable Document Format | pdf |
| Open XML Paper Specification | xps |
| Tag Image File Format | tiff |
| PowerPoint Open XML Presentation | pptx |
| PowerPoint Open XML Slide Show | ppsx |
| PowerPoint 97-2003 Presentation | ppt |
| Hypertext Markup Language | html |
| JPEG File Interchange Format | jpeg |
| Portable Network Graphic | png |
| And many more... | |

## Understanding the APIs

Different conversion scenarios require different APIs:

| API | Method | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| /slides/convert/{format} | POST | Converts a presentation and returns the result |
| /slides/convert/{format} | PUT | Converts a presentation and saves it to storage |
| /slides/{name}/{format} | POST | Converts a storage presentation and returns the result |
| /slides/{name}/{format} | PUT | Converts a storage presentation and saves to storage |

## Step 1: Setting Up Authentication

Before making API calls, we need to authenticate:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.aspose.cloud/connect/token" \
     -d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
```

Save the access token from the response for the following requests.

## Step 2: Converting a Presentation to PDF

Let's start with a common scenario: converting a local PowerPoint file to PDF.

### Try it yourself with cURL

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/slides/convert/pdf" \
     -H "authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
     -H "accept: multipart/form-data" \
     --data-binary @MyPresentation.pptx \
     -o MyPresentation.pdf
```

### What's happening?

1. We're making a POST request to convert a presentation to PDF format
2. We're sending the presentation file in the request body
3. We're saving the response as a local PDF file

## Step 3: Converting with Specific Options

Most conversion formats support specific options to customize the output. Let's convert to PDF with custom options:

### Try it yourself with cURL

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/slides/convert/pdf" \
     -H "authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
     -H "accept: multipart/form-data" \
     -F "file=@MyPresentation.pptx" \
     -F "data=@options.json;filename=" \
     -o MyPresentation.pdf
```

Where `options.json` contains:

```json
{
    "DrawSlidesFrame": true,
    "JpegQuality": 90,
    "Compliance": "PdfUa"
}
```

These options:
- Add frames around slides
- Set JPEG quality in the PDF to 90
- Make the PDF comply with PDF/UA accessibility standard

## Step 4: Converting a Presentation from Storage to PDF

If your presentation is already stored in Aspose Cloud storage, you can convert it directly:

### Try it yourself with cURL

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/slides/MyPresentation.pptx/pdf?folder=MyFolder" \
     -H "authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     -H "accept: multipart/form-data" \
     -o MyPresentation.pdf
```

### What's happening?

1. We're specifying the presentation path in the API URL
2. We're indicating which folder contains the presentation
3. The API retrieves the presentation, converts it, and returns the PDF

## Step 5: Converting to Multiple Image Formats

Let's convert a presentation to PNG images (one image per slide):

### Try it yourself with cURL

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/slides/convert/png" \
     -H "authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
     -H "accept: multipart/form-data" \
     --data-binary @MyPresentation.pptx \
     -o MyPresentation.zip
```

### Important Note

When converting to image formats like PNG or JPEG, the API returns a ZIP archive containing one image per slide. The .zip extension should be added to the output file.

## Step 6: Implementing with SDKs

Let's see how to implement PDF conversion using different programming languages:

### C# Example

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-Slides-cloud/aspose-Slides-cloud-dotnet

using Aspose.Slides.Cloud.Sdk;
using Aspose.Slides.Cloud.Sdk.Model;
using System.IO;

class ConvertPresentationToPdf
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Setup client credentials
        SlidesApi api = new SlidesApi("YOUR_CLIENT_ID", "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET");

        // Set PDF export options
        PdfExportOptions pdfOptions = new PdfExportOptions
        {
            DrawSlidesFrame = true,
            JpegQuality = 90,
            Compliance = PdfExportOptions.ComplianceEnum.PdfUa
        };

        // Convert the presentation to PDF
        using (var presentationStream = File.OpenRead("MyPresentation.pptx"))
        using (var pdfStream = api.Convert(presentationStream, ExportFormat.Pdf, options: pdfOptions))
        {
            // Save the PDF document
            using (var fileStream = File.Create("MyPresentation.pdf"))
            {
                pdfStream.CopyTo(fileStream);
            }
            
            System.Console.WriteLine("Presentation successfully converted to PDF!");
        }
    }
}
```

### Python Example

```python
# For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-Slides-cloud/aspose-Slides-cloud-python

import asposeslidescloud
from asposeslidescloud.apis.slides_api import SlidesApi
from asposeslidescloud.models.pdf_export_options import PdfExportOptions
from asposeslidescloud.models.export_format import ExportFormat

# Setup client credentials
slides_api = SlidesApi(None, "YOUR_CLIENT_ID", "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET")

# Set PDF export options
pdf_options = PdfExportOptions()
pdf_options.draw_slides_frame = True
pdf_options.jpeg_quality = 90
pdf_options.compliance = "PdfUa"

# Convert the presentation to PDF
with open("MyPresentation.pptx", "rb") as presentation_file:
    pdf_path = slides_api.convert(presentation_file.read(), ExportFormat.PDF, 
                                 None, None, None, None, pdf_options)
    
    print(f"Presentation successfully converted to PDF at: {pdf_path}")
```

### Java Example

```java
// For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-Slides-cloud/aspose-Slides-cloud-java

import com.aspose.slides.ApiException;
import com.aspose.slides.api.SlidesApi;
import com.aspose.slides.model.*;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

public class ConvertPresentationToPdf {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, ApiException {
        // Setup client credentials
        SlidesApi slidesApi = new SlidesApi("YOUR_CLIENT_ID", "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET");

        // Set PDF export options
        PdfExportOptions pdfOptions = new PdfExportOptions();
        pdfOptions.setDrawSlidesFrame(true);
        pdfOptions.setJpegQuality(90);
        pdfOptions.setCompliance(PdfExportOptions.ComplianceEnum.PDFUA);

        // Convert the presentation to PDF
        byte[] presentationData = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get("MyPresentation.pptx"));
        File pdfFile = slidesApi.convert(presentationData, ExportFormat.PDF, 
                                         null, null, null, null, pdfOptions);

        System.out.println("Presentation successfully converted to PDF at: " + pdfFile.getPath());
    }
}
```

## Step 7: Converting and Saving to Storage

If you need to save the converted document to storage instead of downloading it:

### Try it yourself with cURL

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/slides/convert/pdf?outPath=MyFolder/MyPresentation.pdf" \
     -H "authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
     -H "accept: application/json" \
     --data-binary @MyPresentation.pptx
```

This saves the converted PDF directly to the specified path in your storage.

## Troubleshooting Tips

Here are some common issues you might encounter:

1. Conversion Errors: If the presentation has complex features, some formats might not support them. Check the API documentation for format limitations.

2. Missing Fonts: If custom fonts are used in the presentation, they might not be available during conversion. Use the `fontsFolder` parameter to specify a folder with custom fonts.

3. Large Files: For very large presentations, the conversion might time out. Consider using asynchronous conversion methods (see [Track Conversion Progress tutorial](/working-with-documents/track-conversion-status/).

4. Image Quality: When converting to image formats, the default resolution might not be sufficient. Use format-specific options to set higher resolutions.
