# Tutorial: Understanding Search Context Status

## Learning Objectives

In this tutorial, you'll learn:
- Why monitoring search context status is important
- The different states a search context can be in
- How to check the status of a search context
- How to handle different status values in your applications

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, please ensure you have:
- Completed the [Creating Your First Search Context](/reverse-image-search/create-search-context/) tutorial
- A valid search context ID from the previous tutorial
- Your Aspose Cloud credentials (Client ID and Client Secret)
- A valid access token for the Aspose Cloud API

## Why Monitor Search Context Status?

In Aspose.Imaging Cloud's reverse image search system, operations like feature extraction and image searching can take time to complete, especially with large image collections. The search context status allows you to:

- Determine if the context is ready for further operations
- Track the progress of ongoing operations
- Diagnose issues when operations don't complete as expected

## Understanding Search Context States

A search context can be in one of these states:

1. Idle: The search context is ready for operations (initial state)
2. ExtractingFeatures: The API is currently processing and extracting features from images
3. MatchingFeatures: The API is matching features between images (during search operations)
4. Searching: A search operation is in progress

## Step 1: Obtain an Access Token

First, you need to authenticate with the Aspose Cloud API:

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/oauth2/token" \
-X POST \
-d 'grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET' \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-H "Accept: application/json"
```

Save the access token from the response for use in the next step.

## Step 2: Check the Search Context Status

Use the following API call to check the status of your search context:

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3/imaging/ai/imageSearch/YOUR_SEARCH_CONTEXT_ID/status" \
-X GET \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

Replace `YOUR_SEARCH_CONTEXT_ID` with the ID you received when creating the search context and `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the token from Step 1.

## Step 3: Interpret the Response

You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "Id": "76901fe6-1427-4112-9fa2-8261cca7524a",
  "SearchStatus": "Idle",
  "Code": 200,
  "Status": "OK"
}
```

The `SearchStatus` field tells you the current state of your search context:

- Idle: The context is ready for operations
- ExtractingFeatures: Feature extraction is in progress
- MatchingFeatures: Feature matching is in progress
- Searching: A search operation is currently running

## Try It Yourself

Now, let's practice checking the status of your search context:

1. Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET` with your actual credentials
2. Obtain an access token using the first curl command
3. Replace `YOUR_SEARCH_CONTEXT_ID` with your actual search context ID
4. Replace `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the token you received
5. Execute the second curl command to check the status
6. Observe the returned status value

## Using SDK Libraries

### Java SDK Example

```java
import com.aspose.imaging.cloud.sdk.api.ImagingApi;
import com.aspose.imaging.cloud.sdk.model.SearchContextStatus;

public class GetSearchContextStatusExample {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Get your clientId and clientSecret from https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/
        String clientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID";
        String clientSecret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET";
        
        // Create instance of the API
        ImagingApi api = new ImagingApi(clientId, clientSecret);
        
        // Your search context ID from previous operations
        String searchContextId = "YOUR_SEARCH_CONTEXT_ID";
        
        try {
            // Get search context status
            SearchContextStatus status = api.getImageSearchStatus(searchContextId, null, null);
            
            // Print the status information
            System.out.println("Search context ID: " + status.getId());
            System.out.println("Current status: " + status.getSearchStatus());
            
            // Check if the context is ready for operations
            if (status.getSearchStatus().equals("Idle")) {
                System.out.println("The search context is ready for operations");
            } else {
                System.out.println("The search context is busy: " + status.getSearchStatus());
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### .NET SDK Example

```csharp
using Aspose.Imaging.Cloud.Sdk.Api;
using Aspose.Imaging.Cloud.Sdk.Model;
using System;

namespace AsposeImagingCloudTutorials
{
    class GetSearchContextStatusExample
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Get your clientId and clientSecret from https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/
            string clientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID";
            string clientSecret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET";
            
            // Create instance of the API
            ImagingApi api = new ImagingApi(clientId, clientSecret);
            
            // Your search context ID from previous operations
            string searchContextId = "YOUR_SEARCH_CONTEXT_ID";
            
            try
            {
                // Get search context status
                SearchContextStatus status = api.GetImageSearchStatus(searchContextId);
                
                // Print the status information
                Console.WriteLine("Search context ID: " + status.Id);
                Console.WriteLine("Current status: " + status.SearchStatus);
                
                // Check if the context is ready for operations
                if (status.SearchStatus == "Idle")
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("The search context is ready for operations");
                }
                else
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("The search context is busy: " + status.SearchStatus);
                }
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Error: " + ex.Message);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementing Status Checking in Real Applications

In real-world applications, you'll want to implement a polling mechanism to check the status regularly until it returns to "Idle" after operations. Here's a simple pseudocode example:

```
function waitForIdle(searchContextId):
    while true:
        status = getSearchContextStatus(searchContextId)
        if status == "Idle":
            return true
        else:
            wait for 2 seconds
            continue
```

This pattern ensures you don't attempt operations while the search context is busy.

## What You've Learned

In this tutorial, you've learned:
- The importance of monitoring search context status
- The different states a search context can be in
- How to check the status using the REST API
- How to use SDK libraries to check status programmatically
- A pattern for waiting until a search context is ready for operations

## Troubleshooting Tips

- Context Not Found: If you receive an error that the search context doesn't exist, double-check the ID.
- Long-Running Operations: Some operations may take time, especially with large images or collections.
- Authentication Errors: Ensure your access token is valid and hasn't expired.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand how to monitor search context status, you're ready to move on to the next tutorial in our series:

â†’ [Tutorial: Adding Images to Your Search Context](/reverse-image-search/add-image/)

In the next tutorial, you'll learn how to add images to your search context, which is essential for building your image database for searching.

## Further Practice

To reinforce what you've learned:
- Create a script that polls the status until it's "Idle"
- Investigate how the status changes after adding images to the search context
- Create a simple dashboard that displays the current status of your search context
