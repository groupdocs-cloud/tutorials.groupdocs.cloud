# Tutorial: Learn to Convert Web Pages to PDF

## Learning Objectives

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to convert any web page URL to a PDF document using Aspose.PDF Cloud API. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:

- Authenticate with the Aspose.PDF Cloud API
- Convert web pages to PDF documents
- Customize PDF dimensions and orientation
- Adjust page margins for better readability
- Implement the conversion in your applications using REST API calls or SDK methods

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have:

1. An Aspose Cloud account (Sign up for a [free trial](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) if you don't have one)
2. Your Client ID and Client Secret from the Aspose Cloud dashboard
3. A REST API client like cURL, Postman, or your preferred programming language
4. Basic knowledge of REST API concepts

## Tutorial Scenario

Imagine you're developing a web application that needs to archive web content as PDF files. Your users provide URLs, and your application needs to convert these web pages to PDF documents with customizable dimensions and orientation.

## Step 1: Understanding the API Endpoint

For converting web pages to PDF, Aspose.PDF Cloud provides a dedicated endpoint:

```
GET /pdf/create/web
```

This endpoint accepts several parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|-----------|----------|------|-------------|
| url | true | string | The URL of the web page to convert |
| height | false | double | Height of the resulting PDF page |
| width | false | double | Width of the resulting PDF page |
| isLandscape | false | boolean | Page orientation (true for landscape, false for portrait) |
| marginLeft | false | double | Left margin size |
| marginBottom | false | double | Bottom margin size |
| marginRight | false | double | Right margin size |
| marginTop | false | double | Top margin size |

## Step 2: Obtaining Authentication Token

Before making API calls, you need to authenticate with Aspose.Cloud to get an access token.

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/connect/token" \
-X POST \
-d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-H "Accept: application/json"
```

The response will contain an access token that you'll use in subsequent API calls:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciO...",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

## Step 3: Converting a Web Page to PDF

Now, let's convert a web page to PDF using the token obtained in the previous step:

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/pdf/create/web?url=https://www.example.com" \
-X GET \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
--output webpage.pdf
```

Make sure to replace:
- `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the token obtained in Step 2
- `https://www.example.com` with the URL you want to convert

The API will return the PDF file as binary data, which will be saved as "webpage.pdf" in your current directory.

## Step 4: Customizing PDF Dimensions and Orientation

You can customize the generated PDF by specifying additional parameters:

```bash
curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/pdf/create/web?url=https://www.example.com&width=800&height=1200&isLandscape=true&marginLeft=50&marginTop=50&marginRight=50&marginBottom=50" \
-X GET \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
--output customized_webpage.pdf
```

This request will generate a PDF with:
- Page width of 800 units
- Page height of 1200 units
- Landscape orientation
- 50-unit margins on all sides

## Step 5: Implementation in C# Using SDK

For C# developers, Aspose.PDF Cloud provides an SDK that simplifies the integration process:

```csharp
// Example: Convert web page to PDF in C#
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Pdf.Cloud.Sdk.Api;
using Aspose.Pdf.Cloud.Sdk.Model;

namespace WebToPdfExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Get your clientId and clientSecret from https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/
            string clientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID";
            string clientSecret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET";
            
            // Create PDF API client
            var pdfApi = new PdfApi(clientId, clientSecret);
            
            // Specify the web page URL
            string webPageUrl = "https://www.example.com";
            
            // Optional parameters
            double? width = 800;
            double? height = 1200;
            bool? isLandscape = true;
            double? marginLeft = 50;
            double? marginBottom = 50;
            double? marginRight = 50;
            double? marginTop = 50;
            
            try
            {
                // Convert web page to PDF
                var response = pdfApi.GetWebInStorageToPdf(
                    webPageUrl,
                    height,
                    width,
                    isLandscape,
                    marginLeft,
                    marginBottom,
                    marginRight,
                    marginTop
                );
                
                // Save PDF file
                using (FileStream fileStream = File.Create("webpage.pdf"))
                {
                    response.CopyTo(fileStream);
                }
                
                Console.WriteLine("Web page successfully converted to PDF!");
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Error: " + ex.Message);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting Tips

Here are some common issues you might encounter and how to resolve them:

1. Authentication Errors: Make sure your Client ID and Client Secret are correct and haven't expired.
2. 403 Forbidden: Your subscription might not include the PDF API. Check your subscription plan.
3. URL Encoding Issues: Ensure your URL is properly encoded, especially if it contains special characters.
4. Timeout Errors: Some web pages may be too large or complex to convert within the default timeout period. Try breaking down the content or using a simpler URL.
