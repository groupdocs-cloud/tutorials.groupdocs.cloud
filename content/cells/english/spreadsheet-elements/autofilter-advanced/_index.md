# Tutorial: Advanced Filtering Techniques

In this tutorial, you'll learn advanced filtering techniques in Excel worksheets using Aspose.Cells Cloud API. Advanced filtering allows you to perform complex data analysis by filtering information based on specific criteria such as dates, custom conditions, colors, and more.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:
- Implement date-based filters for temporal data
- Create custom filters with complex criteria
- Filter for top or bottom values in your data
- Apply color-based filters
- Understand when to use each filtering technique

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- An Aspose Cloud account with an active subscription or trial
- Your Client ID and Client Secret from the [Aspose Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps)
- Basic understanding of RESTful APIs and Excel filtering
- An Excel file with varied data types to practice advanced filtering

## Understanding Advanced Filtering

While basic filters allow simple value-based filtering, advanced filtering techniques provide more powerful tools for data analysis. Let's explore these techniques.

### 1. Date Filters

Date filters are essential for analyzing time-based data. You can filter data by specific dates, date ranges, or relative time periods.

#### Step 1: Understand the API Endpoint

The endpoint to add a date filter is:

```
PUT http://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/cells/{name}/worksheets/{sheetName}/autoFilter/dateFilter
```

Where:
- `{name}` is your Excel file name
- `{sheetName}` is the worksheet name

#### Step 2: Make the API Request

Let's add a date filter to show only data from the year 2023 in a worksheet named "Sales" from a file called "SalesHistory.xlsx".

##### Using cURL:

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/cells/SalesHistory.xlsx/worksheets/Sales/autoFilter/dateFilter?range=A1:F50&fieldIndex=0&dateTimeGroupingType=Year&year=2023&refresh=true" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>" \
-H "Accept: application/json"
```

> Note: Replace `<your_access_token>` with your actual bearer token obtained from Aspose Cloud.

The parameters used are:
- `range=A1:F50`: The data range including headers
- `fieldIndex=0`: The column index to filter (column A)
- `dateTimeGroupingType=Year`: Filter by year
- `year=2023`: The specific year to filter for
- `refresh=true`: Refresh the filter immediately

##### Using Python SDK:

```python
# Tutorial Code Example: Date Filtering
import asposecellscloud
from asposecellscloud.apis.cells_api import CellsApi
from asposecellscloud.models import *
from asposecellscloud.requests import *

# Configure API credentials
client_id = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
client_secret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
api = CellsApi(client_id, client_secret)

# Specify file and filter details
file_name = "SalesHistory.xlsx"
sheet_name = "Sales"
range_to_filter = "A1:F50"
field_index = 0      # First column (A) containing dates
date_time_grouping_type = "Year"
year = 2023
refresh = True

# Add the date filter
response = api.put_worksheet_date_filter(
    name=file_name,
    sheet_name=sheet_name,
    range=range_to_filter,
    field_index=field_index,
    date_time_grouping_type=date_time_grouping_type,
    year=year,
    refresh=refresh
)

print(f"Date filter applied: {response.status}")

# Expected output:
# Date filter applied: OK
```

##### Sample Response:

```json
{
  "Code": 200,
  "Status": "OK"
}
```

#### Different Date Filter Types

You can filter dates in various ways by changing the `dateTimeGroupingType` parameter:

- `Year`: Filter by specific year
- `Month`: Filter by month
- `Day`: Filter by day of month
- `Hour`: Filter by hour
- `Minute`: Filter by minute
- `Second`: Filter by second

For example, to filter for sales in March (regardless of year):

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/cells/SalesHistory.xlsx/worksheets/Sales/autoFilter/dateFilter?range=A1:F50&fieldIndex=0&dateTimeGroupingType=Month&month=3&refresh=true" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>" \
-H "Accept: application/json"
```

### 2. Custom Filters

Custom filters allow you to define complex criteria for filtering your data, such as showing values that meet multiple conditions.

#### Using cURL:

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/cells/SalesHistory.xlsx/worksheets/Sales/autoFilter/custom?range=A1:F50&fieldIndex=2&operatorType1=GreaterThan&criteria1=5000&isAnd=true&operatorType2=LessThan&criteria2=10000" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>" \
-H "Accept: application/json"
```

This creates a filter for column C (fieldIndex=2) showing only values that are both greater than 5000 AND less than 10000.

#### Using C# SDK:

```csharp
// Tutorial Code Example: Custom Filtering
using Aspose.Cells.Cloud.SDK.Api;
using Aspose.Cells.Cloud.SDK.Model;
using System;

namespace AsposeCellsAdvancedFilteringExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Configure API credentials
            var cellsApi = new CellsApi("YOUR_CLIENT_ID", "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET");
            
            // Specify file details
            string fileName = "SalesHistory.xlsx";
            string sheetName = "Sales";
            string range = "A1:F50";
            int fieldIndex = 2;  // Column C
            
            // Define custom filter criteria
            string operatorType1 = "GreaterThan";
            string criteria1 = "5000";
            bool isAnd = true;  // Use AND logic (both conditions must be true)
            string operatorType2 = "LessThan";
            string criteria2 = "10000";
            
            // Apply the custom filter
            var response = cellsApi.PutWorksheetCustomFilter(
                fileName,
                sheetName,
                range,
                fieldIndex,
                operatorType1,
                criteria1,
                isAnd,
                operatorType2,
                criteria2
            );
            
            Console.WriteLine($"Custom filter applied: {response.Status}");
            Console.WriteLine("Now showing only sales between $5,000 and $10,000");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Custom Filter Operators

The API supports various operators for custom filters:

- `GreaterThan`: Values greater than the specified criteria
- `LessThan`: Values less than the specified criteria
- `GreaterOrEqual`: Values greater than or equal to the criteria
- `LessOrEqual`: Values less than or equal to the criteria
- `Equal`: Values equal to the criteria
- `NotEqual`: Values not equal to the criteria
- `Contains`: Values containing the specified text
- `DoesNotContain`: Values not containing the specified text
- `BeginsWith`: Values beginning with the specified text
- `EndsWith`: Values ending with the specified text

### 3. Top/Bottom Filters

Top/Bottom filters allow you to show only the highest or lowest values in your data.

#### Using cURL:

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/cells/SalesHistory.xlsx/worksheets/Sales/autoFilter/filterTop10?range=A1:F50&fieldIndex=2&isTop=true&isPercent=false&itemCount=5" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>" \
-H "Accept: application/json"
```

This will filter column C (fieldIndex=2) to show only the top 5 values.

#### Using Java SDK:

```java
// Tutorial Code Example: Top/Bottom Filtering
import com.aspose.cells.cloud.api.CellsApi;
import com.aspose.cells.cloud.model.*;
import com.aspose.cells.cloud.request.*;

public class TopFilterExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Configure API credentials
        CellsApi api = new CellsApi("YOUR_CLIENT_ID", "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET");
        
        // Specify file details
        String fileName = "SalesHistory.xlsx";
        String sheetName = "Sales";
        
        try {
            // Define filter parameters
            String range = "A1:F50";
            int fieldIndex = 2;          // Column C
            boolean isTop = true;        // Filter for top values (use false for bottom values)
            boolean isPercent = false;   // Count as absolute number (use true for percentage)
            int itemCount = 5;           // Show top 5 items
            
            // Apply the Top 10 filter
            PutWorksheetFilterTop10Request request = new PutWorksheetFilterTop10Request(
                fileName,
                sheetName,
                range,
                fieldIndex,
                isTop,
                isPercent,
                itemCount,
                null,  // matchBlanks
                true,  // refresh
                null,  // folder
                null   // storageName
            );
            
            CellsCloudResponse response = api.putWorksheetFilterTop10(request);
            System.out.println("Top filter applied successfully: " + response.getStatus());
            
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

You can also filter for the bottom values by setting `isTop=false`, or filter by percentage by setting `isPercent=true`.

### 4. Color Filters

Color filters allow you to filter data based on cell background or font color. This is useful for visually formatted data.

#### Using cURL:

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/cells/SalesHistory.xlsx/worksheets/Sales/autoFilter/colorFilter?range=A1:F50&fieldIndex=4" \
-d '{ "Pattern": "Solid", "ForegroundColor": { "Color": { "A": 255, "R": 255, "G": 0, "B": 0 } } }' \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json"
```

This will filter column E (fieldIndex=4) to show only cells with a red background color.

#### Using Python SDK:

```python
# Tutorial Code Example: Color Filtering
import asposecellscloud
from asposecellscloud.apis.cells_api import CellsApi
from asposecellscloud.models import *
from asposecellscloud.requests import *

# Configure API credentials
client_id = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
client_secret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
api = CellsApi(client_id, client_secret)

# Specify file and filter details
file_name = "SalesHistory.xlsx"
sheet_name = "Sales"
range_to_filter = "A1:F50"
field_index = 4  # Column E

# Create color object
color = Color(
    a=255,  # Alpha
    r=255,  # Red
    g=0,    # Green
    b=0     # Blue
)

# Create color filter
color_filter = ColorFilterRequest(
    pattern="Solid",
    foreground_color=CellsColor(color=color)
)

# Apply the color filter
response = api.put_worksheet_color_filter(
    name=file_name,
    sheet_name=sheet_name,
    range=range_to_filter,
    field_index=field_index,
    color_filter=color_filter,
    match_blanks=False,
    refresh=True
)

print(f"Color filter applied: {response.status}")

# Expected output:
# Color filter applied: OK
```

## Combining Multiple Filters

For more complex analysis, you can apply multiple filters to different columns. Each filter works in conjunction with others, so only rows that satisfy all filter criteria will be shown.

For example, to show only:
1. Sales from 2023 (Column A)
2. With values between 5000 and 10000 (Column C)
3. From a specific sales representative (Column E)

You would apply three separate filters, one for each condition.

## Try It Yourself

Now that you've learned advanced filtering techniques, try these exercises to reinforce your knowledge:

1. Exercise 1: Apply a date filter to show only data from the last quarter
2. Exercise 2: Create a custom filter for values that begin with a specific prefix
3. Exercise 3: Filter to show the top 10% of values in a column
4. Exercise 4: Combine multiple filters to perform a complex data analysis

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Date Filter Not Working Correctly
If your date filter isn't working as expected:
- Verify that the column contains actual date values (not text that looks like dates)
- Check that your date parameters (year, month, day) are appropriate for your data
- Make sure the field index points to the column containing dates

### Issue 2: Custom Filter Not Showing Expected Results
For issues with custom filters:
- Double-check your operator types are appropriate for your data
- Verify the logical operator (isAnd/isOr) is appropriate for your needs
- Ensure your criteria values match the data format in your cells
