# Aspose.CAD Cloud API Image Scaling Tutorials

Welcome to our hands-on tutorial series on changing the scale of CAD images using Aspose.CAD Cloud API. These tutorials are designed to take you from basic to advanced operations for resizing and scaling your CAD drawings in the cloud.

## What You'll Learn

In this tutorial series, you'll learn how to:

- Resize CAD drawings to specific dimensions
- Change scale proportionally or non-proportionally
- Implement scaling operations across various programming languages
- Handle advanced scaling scenarios for different file formats
- Create efficient scaling workflows for your applications

## Tutorial Learning Path

Follow this structured learning path to build your skills progressively:

### Beginner Tutorials

1. [Introduction to Image Scaling with Aspose.CAD Cloud](/change-scale-of-an-image/introduction/) - Learn the fundamental concepts of image scaling and the available API endpoints (20 min)

2. [Basic Image Resizing Using GET Method](/change-scale-of-an-image/basic-get-method/) - Scale CAD drawings with simple parameters using HTTP GET requests (30 min)

3. [Uploading and Scaling Images with POST Method](/change-scale-of-an-image/basic-post-method/) - Learn to scale CAD images by uploading them directly in a POST request (30 min)

### Intermediate Tutorials

4. [Working with Different Output Formats](/change-scale-of-an-image/output-formats/) - Scale CAD drawings and convert them to various formats in a single operation (45 min)

5. [Proportional vs Non-Proportional Scaling](/change-scale-of-an-image/proportional-scaling/) - Control aspect ratio when scaling your CAD drawings (40 min)

6. [SDK Implementation in C#](/change-scale-of-an-image/sdk-csharp/) - Implement scaling operations in C# applications using the SDK (50 min)

### Advanced Tutorials

7. [Batch Processing Multiple CAD Files](/change-scale-of-an-image/batch-processing/) - Scale multiple CAD drawings efficiently in batch operations (60 min)

## Prerequisites

Before starting these tutorials, you should have:

- An Aspose Cloud account (sign up for a [free trial](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) if you don't have one)
- Basic knowledge of RESTful APIs
- Familiarity with at least one programming language (C#, Python, Java, etc.)
- Basic understanding of CAD file formats (DWG, DXF, etc.)

## Getting Started

To get the most out of these tutorials:

1. Follow the tutorials in order for progressive learning
2. Complete the "Try it yourself" sections for hands-on practice
3. Experiment with the provided code examples using your own CAD files
4. Check your understanding with the learning checkpoints

Each tutorial includes estimated completion time, clearly defined learning objectives, and practical code examples to ensure you gain both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.
